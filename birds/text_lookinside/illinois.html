<h4>Illinois, May 27, Ferne Clyffe State Park.</h4>

<p>An hour and a quarter before sunrise, I'm perched at the cliff's edge, comfortable in my camp chair, listening, smiling, breathing deeply, as if a deep breath might capture in my chest all that I feel and see and hear ... purple martins are high overhead, a small cloud of older males drifting about up there, perhaps luring late-migrating yearlings to the colony ... <em>chuck-WILL'S-WID-ow</em>, just below, loud and clear, a more faint <em>WILL'S-WID</em> heard from two others in the distance ... an indigo bunting bursts into song, as if unloading some nightmare, then is silent ... and a raucous outburst from a great crested flycatcher, then he too is silent ...</p>

<p>Just to my right awakes an Acadian flycatcher, a Mosquito Prince, an <em>Empidonax</em>: <em>seet, seet, seet, seet, seet PEET-sah! seet, seet, seet PEET-sah!</em> So energized, he calls repeatedly between the songs that he'll use in a less frenzied state throughout the day. Two phoebes, left and right--the pace escalates, each rapidly alternating his two songs, <em>FEE-bee, FEE-b-bre-be, FEE-bee, FEE-b-bre-be</em>, each in typical phoebe cadence, hustling to the <em>FEE-b-bre-be</em>, taking a micro-second breather before offering the next <em>FEE-bee</em>, the songs and their delivery all dictated by phoebe genes.</p>

<p><em>Pit-i-tuck</em>. A summer tanager awakes, soon singing from the small oak just downslope. Like the scarlet, his dawn singing is also disjointed, the song phrases delivered deliberately but continuously, without pit-i-tuck punctuations. </p>

<p>As shadows give way to emerging colors in the landscape, the dawn singers yield to the day as well, and I listen to their changing voices, focusing on ... warblers, tanagers, buntings, flycatchers ... and nearly two hours after sunrise, I accept that the bicycle awaits, leaving my dawn perch for another day of listening on the road.</p>
