<p>Twenty-three songs from a mountain chickadee, part of a longer 28-minute session during which he sang this same song throughout. </p>

<p><em>Fa-beeee-beeee-beeee</em>? Does that mnemonic come close? Four whistles all on the same frequency, with the first just 1/20th of a second, the other three about 1/3rd of a second. He uses this song throughout the 28 minutes, as if he had no other, and perhaps he doesn't. This song with the three loud whistles is the one we hear throughout the Rockies of Colorado.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Ruby-crowned kinglet, hairy woodpecker, another mountain chickadee (<em>tsick-a-dee-dee-dee</em>), hermit thrush.</p>
