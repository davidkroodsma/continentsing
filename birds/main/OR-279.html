<p>What's a feisty, aggressive black-billed magpie to do when he or she finds an unwitting visitor standing near its nest? Perch in a nearby tree, just yards away, and complain, at least that seems to be the tone of voice. I didn't realize it all at the time, as it was minutes later when I looked around and saw the big stick nest just off to the right. </p>
