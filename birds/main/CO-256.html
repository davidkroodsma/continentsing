<p>In the predawn darkness, a hermit thrush can be elusive and skittish, and I sneak from one of his singing perches to another trying to capture him, but he never seems to settle down. </p>

<p>Then, when I think it is a lost cause, he lands just above me, in clear view, offering this remarkable series of songs. In the first minute alone are 22 songs, faster than a song every three seconds, near top speed for a hermit thrush. Just listen to him spring from one pitch to another. </p>

<p>Maybe you can pick out a distinctive song and hear him return to it 10-12 songs later? In <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-334">OR-334</a> and <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-347">OR-347</a> I offer suggestions on how to listen to hermit thrushes.</p>
