<p>I'm going to let this robin have his say:</p>

<p>How much less interesting birdsong would be without the American robin to provide some intrigue! This bird begins in typical fashion here, singing a string of low carols followed by a soft, high <em>hisselly</em> note. It's not always easy to tell which is the ending <em>hisselly</em> phrase and which is still a carol, partly because he sometimes mutes the carol, making it sound more like a <em>hisselly</em>. But don't worry about the details--just feel the overall rhythm.</p>

<p>Before long, however, there are more and more <em>hisselly</em> phrases. I'm fascinated, and you hear my footsteps as I walk closer to him. Then he seems to moderate some, singing few <em>hisselly</em> phrases, but then the <em>hisselly</em> phrases surge again. And he's on a tear, with none of the standard pause that one expects after a <em>hisselly</em> and before the next carol. Soon it seems he's singing all hisselly notes, together with a high, thin note that's typically thought of as the "hawk alarm" (first heard at 4:55). He introduces some of the other calls in his vocabulary, too (e.g., 6:14, 6:18), so that the low caroled phrases have all but disappeared from his performance.</p>

<p>Finally, at 9:29, he flies from the oak to the pine tree across the parking lot, and then he unleashes a string of 17 carols in nine seconds, followed by a single <em>hisselly</em>! What gives now?</p>

<p>Then a rather odd thing happens. Normally, he would deliver his carols and <em>hisselly</em>s with considerable variety, and one never knows what's coming next, but he's anything but normal here. For ten seconds, from 9:57.5 to 10:07.5, he's stuck on three different carols (A, B, C) and a single hisselly (1), so that his singing sequence here is 1 A 1 B A 1 A 1 A C B 1 A B B 1 C 1 A 1 C 1 B. That's 23 phrases in 10 seconds, more than one every half second, at a clip of 138 phrases per minute. What's got into him?</p>

<p>He continues on through this 15 minute selection, varying his performance in the most unpredictable ways, "singing" his calls and alarms and <em>hisselly</em>s and carols, muting them at times, and delivering them in combinations that, to him no doubt, the situation calls for. </p>

<p>And just what might that situation be? What's going through his head for him to express himself in this fashion? There was a scarlet tanager nearby, but I don't think that he'd obsess about the tanager. It must have been another robin, and I thought I caught a glimpse of one, but could never quite be sure. It was back there at 9:29 when the robin flew to the pine that I thought I saw the other one, perhaps a competitor up there in the pine, and that was when the string of low carols was unleashed.
Let there be no doubt: I love robins!</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Scarlet tanager, tufted titmouse, ovenbird, pileated woodpecker, chipping sparrow, eastern wood-pewee, blue-gray gnatcatcher, red-eyed vireo. Several times (e.g., 6:38, 8:14, 9:15) a "hoarse robin" scarlet tanager sings--don't confuse his burry songs with that of the robin. A tufted titmouse calls loudly at 11:47, then sings a little later.   </p>
