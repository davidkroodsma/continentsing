<p>The two of us stand, side by side, happy, leaning on each other, facing the camera with the Grotto behind us. Grotto, definition from internet: "small picturesque cave, especially an artificial one in a park or garden." Yes, it does look artificial, shaped by human hands with openings willy nilly off to the side and top, the grotto having been built up over time as dissolved silicates in the boiling water precipitate out when the water evaporates. It's bubbling away here, not a serious eruption, which apparently happens roughly every eight hours.</p>
