<p>Bewick's wren, ten songs in a little under a minute, a song every five to six seconds. This is the third song type from this male.</p>

<p>Here are the four different Bewick's wren songs that I recorded at my favorite Finley refuge location: <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-355">OR-355</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-356">OR-356</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-357">OR-357</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-358">OR-358</a>.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>
