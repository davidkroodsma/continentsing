<p>A Wilson's snipe winnows overhead. I stand ankle deep in water, following this speck in the sky as he circles around me, twisting me in knots as I try to keep the parabolic reflector aimed at him. Sometimes he's near, sometimes far.</p>

<p>During each minute he winnows five times times, <em>wuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu  . . . wuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu</em>  . . . completing a five-second winnow roughly every 12 seconds. Almost half the time he's in a dive and a little more than half the time he's recovering, preparing for the next.  </p>
