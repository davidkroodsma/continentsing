<p>Four songs of a Lincoln's sparrow, the first wonderfully complex and three and a half seconds long, the last three simpler and very similar to each other. Listening to only the last three songs here or the entire previous recording (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-213">CO-213</a>), one might think that a male Lincoln's sparrow sings with little variety, but eventually he often reveals how he can rearrange his song elements and introduce others to produce a considerable variety of songs. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Another Lincoln's sparrow, yellow warbler, brown-headed cowbird (male song, female rattle; 0:09), sandhill crane (0:13, 0:21, 0:28), MacGillivray's warbler, two drumming ruffed grouse (0:44-0:59; you can see them in Raven-lite, the characteristic rhythm of the drum down on the baseline, but I can't hear the low-frequency sounds that carry so far).</p>
