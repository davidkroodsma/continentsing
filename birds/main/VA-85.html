<p>An eastern kingbird in dawn song, at the top of a small tree beside the lake. He sputters and stutters in his harsh, strident voice, <em>tttzeer, ttzeetzeetzee, tttzeer, tttzeer, TTZEETZEETZEE</em>, as if trying a dozen or more times per minute to pronounce the word explicit, but . . . making a miserable, stuttering failure of it, said one early naturalist (Walter Faxon).</p>

<p>He is perched, but when the density of kingbirds is higher (perhaps thats the primary reason?), males sing in the dark from high above their territories. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Off to the left is a chipping sparrow in dawn song, sputtering his short songs with just a few phrases, sometimes as few as two or three. Purple martin and tree swallow are in dawn song; other sounds are a Baltimore oriole, fish jumping in the lake.</p>
