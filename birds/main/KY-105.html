<p>Throughout the night he sang, a bachelor announcing he was available, and at dawn I finally got out of the tent and stood next to him, this brief selection of nearly 15 minutes telling of other birds in his life.</p>

<p>I begin listening . . . hearing imitations . . .</p>

<p>0:14, blue jay</p>

<p>0:19, northern flicker <em>klee-yer!</em> call</p>

<p>0:23, red-bellied woodpecker call</p>

<p>0:25-0:32, northern flicker <em>klee-yer!</em> call again</p>

<p>0:35, blue jay (0:39-0:42, probably also blue jay)</p>

<p>0:46-0:51, purple martin</p>

<p>0:53-0:48, Carolina wren</p>

<p>0:59-1:05, tufted titmouse</p>

<p>Oh, all that in the first minute--he is a fine mimic. I'll pick out a few of my favorites in the following minutes:</p>

<p>1:26, blue jay and hairy/downy woodpecker call alternated</p>

<p>1:40, Carolina chickadee song</p>

<p>2:16, eastern bluebird</p>

<p>3:22, blue jay</p>

<p>5:18, purple martin</p>

<p>5:48, eastern bluebird again</p>

<p>7:38, northern flicker <em>wik-wik-wik</em> song (again at 9:08, and 11:58)</p>

<p>7:52, tufted titmouse again</p>

<p>11:52, Carolina wren (again)</p>

<p>What a challenge to try to identify all that he has pilfered and translated into mockingbirdese!</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>At this time of the morning, all of Hodgenville's American robins are singing by streetlights. And all of Hodgenville is stirring, with traffic humming throughout the city. </p>
