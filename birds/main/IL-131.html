<p>A northern parula in dawn mode, chipping between songs. Two complex phrases start the song, followed by four ascending raspy notes: <em>twee-de-de-de twee-de-de-de zhree zhreee zhreee zhreee</em>; he hustles through the <em>twee-de-de-de</em> notes and lingers on the <em>zhreee</em> notes. A western bird, to be sure, given that we are far west of the transition zone in Kentucky, and I wonder whether the dawn songs of the western birds are also consistently different from those of the eastern birds. </p>
