<p>A prairie warbler offering five of his buzzy, daytime songs. The notes in these buzzy songs are brief, about seven per second, with a longer buzzy note on the end. These are the "mate-attraction songs," those used when the male is interacting with females, or singing in a relaxed state.</p>

<p>Contrast these buzzy songs with the more tonal, aggressive songs that males use when fighting or during the dawn chorus (see <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-33">VA-33</a>). </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Common yellowthroat, eastern towhee.</p>
