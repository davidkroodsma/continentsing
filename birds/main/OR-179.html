<p>Pied-billed grebes, on a pond surrounded by marsh, hence the rich soundscape of wetland birds here. At least three pairs are calling on this pond. Just listen to the extended series of <em>kuk kuk kuk</em> notes at the beginning of a song, how they transition into a series of <em>kaow kaow kaow</em> notes, the entire song lasting perhaps 15 seconds. I'm not sure whether two or three birds are involved in the sequence from 0:05 to 0:35. </p>

<p>As two pairs approach each other, there's a rush and splashing (2:22), and near the end of this selection (3:07) two birds greet each other, most likely male and female, with a rapid series of <em>ek-ek-ek</em> calls, followed by <em>kaow kaow</em> calls. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>
