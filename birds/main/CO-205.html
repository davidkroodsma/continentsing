<p>Sometimes you make do with what you have, and that's the case with this recording. I am very fond of it, no matter how poor it is by many standards. This is the first lesser goldfinch I ever heard, and he's singing above my sleeping son in Guffey, Colorado, our bicycles lying nearby. </p>

<p>This goldfinch sings quickly, with mimicry so imbedded into the flow of his song that I find it almost impossible to ferret it out. But take those first two calls; sounds like a house sparrow, doesn't it?  House sparrow again at 0:06. Robin calls jump out at me at 0:37. But it's tough going, to be sure. </p>

<p>Crowing roosters, traffic . . . a pretty lousy recording!</p>
