<p>A light rain doesn't stop this willow flycatcher from perching out in the open and singing.</p>

<p>In the first two 30-second segments (see KY-82 for description of the songs):  </p>

<p><em>Creet, FITZ-bew, FITZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, FIZZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, creet</em></p>

<p><em>FITZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, creet, FIZZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew</em></p>

<p>I find curious the relative abundance of the three sounds. Eight <em>creet</em>'s, eight <em>FITZ-bew</em>'s, but only two <em>FIZZ-bew</em>'s. He has choices, I know, as to how he uses his three songs, though I don't know why he would sing more of one than another. </p>

<p>I wonder what he does in minutes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 here? Be my guest as you chart them out.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Rain. Yellow-headed blackbirds, yellow warbler, marsh wren, tree swallow, red-winged blackbird, ducks, song sparrow, American wigeon, ring-necked pheasant.</p>
