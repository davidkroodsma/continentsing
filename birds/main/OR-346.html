<p>This Townsend's solitaire seems highly animated as he countersings with another male mid-morning, with relatively few other birds singing, with only the wind to compete with, it seems. His songs are up to 11 seconds in duration (0:51-1:02) and follow quickly one after the other, no two anything alike.</p>

<p>At one point I'm struck by what sounds like the <em>THREE BEERS!</em> portion of an olive-sided flycatcher song (at 0:23), and I listen for it again, but the sound never recurs. Almost surely, I feel, he's mimicked this song from the flycatcher, and I bet there is other mimicry that I don't recognize that is imbedded in the stream of song from him. </p>

<p>After three and a half minutes, he's had enough singing, and he reverts to his call, a brief, intense whistled note about a tenth of a second in duration. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Another Townsend's solitaire, mountain chickadee, warbler at 1:12 and 1:45, and wind in the ponderosa pines. </p>
