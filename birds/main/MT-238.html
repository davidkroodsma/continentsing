<p>In the rain, a least flycatcher struts his stuff, a <em>cheBEK</em> repeated over and over, faster than one per second. The song genes of this bird are basically the same as they are for the birds back in Virginia (see VA-54, VA-55)</p>

<p>By 1:20, this least flycatcher is joined by a gray catbird, both of them now singing in the rain. I hear no continuously stunning mimicry from this catbird, though theres the occasional sound reminding me of . . . an American robin (1:21, 1:47), tree swallow (1:41), a <em>Klee-yer!</em> call of a flicker (1:50), a perfect <em>bzeeyeer</em> of a western wood-pewee (2:45).</p>
