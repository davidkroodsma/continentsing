<p>Late morning, insects seem to rule the soundscape. </p>

<p>But there's an alder flycatcher among them! Throughout he gives his standard <em>fee-BEE-o</em> song, or <em>frree-BREER-a</em>, depending on your favorite mnemonic. But there's more to him, as interspersed among his songs are <em>tu-weet</em> calls (e.g., 0:02, 0:09) that fall and then rise. </p>

<p>Enjoy the flies, bees, whatever insects they all are!</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Flies abound. A house wren (e.g., 0:06), song sparrow (0:10), chestnut-sided warbler (1:33), Canada warbler (1:13). </p>
