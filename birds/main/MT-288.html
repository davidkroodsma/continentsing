<p>A northern waterthrush and his neighbor sing initially, each with a typical three-parted song. The songs of these birds are almost identical to each other, best heard in back-to-back songs from the two birds beginning at 0:03 and again at 0:12. The background bird then becomes less noticeable. </p>

<p>A song sparrow chimes in (0:08), repeating his song in the background until he's last heard at 1:34. </p>

<p>How stunning to hear the familiar, loud <em>hey-sweetie</em> of a black-capped chickadee (0:31)! It's a nice reminder of how similar these learned songs are across the country (and fun to anticipate the different songs that we'll hear west of the Cascades in Oregon). </p>

<p>After the last northern waterthrush song (at 1:34), yellow warblers dominate the background, the chickadee offering a few more <em>hey-sweetie</em> songs as well. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A second northern waterthrush, Wilson's snipe winnows, song sparrow, black-capped chickadee (0:31), veery, yellow warbler, and the ever present rippling of this North Fork of the Big Hole River.</p>
