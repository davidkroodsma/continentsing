<p>An American wigeon swims upstream, calling six times, a three-parted, airy whistle, <em>wee WHEE whew</em>, the first <em>wee</em> note barely audible over the river noise. Hes accompanied by the harsh quacks of what may be a female wigeon. Just before the males last <em>wee WHEE whew</em>, a Clark's nutcracker sounds off (0:23), and two nutcrackers are heard again after 0:45. The quacking duck occurs again at 0:56-1:11.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Northern waterthrush, American Robin, yellow warbler, ruby-crowned kinglet, Clark's nutcracker, western wood-pewee, and the hissy flow of water in the North Fork of the Big Hole River.</p>
