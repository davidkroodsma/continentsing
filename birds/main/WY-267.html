<p>A mountain chickadee calls initially, offering its classic <em>tsick-a-dee-dee</em> (0:10), then sings its pure tonal whistles: <em>be-bee-bee, be-bee-bee-bee, be-bee-bee-ba-baa</em>, with the ending <em>ba-baa</em> lower in frequency, and other combinations. One could think of his complete song throughout as <em>be-bee-bee-bee-ba-baa</em>, with many of his renditions simply incomplete, omitting various notes.</p>

<p>How he thinks of his songs is, of course, a different matter. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Ruby-crowned kinglet, hermit thrush, dark-eyed junco, chipping sparrow, yellow-rumped warbler. The Firehole River and the general hiss of bubbling pools in the Upper Basin. </p>
