<p>Seven daytime songs of a Brewer's Sparrow, each a second-long buzzy phrase followed by a second and a half series of repeated syllables. Perhaps you hear it as something like <em>zrreeeeeeeee zir zir zir zir zir zir zir</em>.</p>

<p>One thinks of the Brewer's Sparrow as inhabiting arid sagebrush, but as heard in this recording, this male has set up residence next to a delightful stream that drains the mountainside here.</p>

<p>Listening to the songs of the Brewer's sparrow at dawn (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-215">CO-215</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-216">CO-216</a>) and througout the day (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-219">ID-219</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-220">ID-220</a>), one can hardly believe they're the same species. </p>
