<p>A Swainson's thrush awakes not with songs but with calls. How many different ones he has no one seems to know, but at least three matters are clear. </p>

<p>First, one call can grade into another, perhaps creating infinite variations; listen to the sequence from 0:17 to 0:26 and you feel this transition. </p>

<p>Second, a given call can vary from one rendition to the next; from 0:26 to 1:28, hear how the duration of that particular call varies. </p>

<p>Third, these thrushes talk to each other with these calls, often matching each other's calls, responding in some way to each other's vocal efforts; listen from 0:50 to 1:27 and you hear how the foreground and background males match each other with that ringing, tonal note, and how at 1:29-1:32 both birds switch to another call, again matching each other.</p>
