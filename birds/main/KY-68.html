<p>Outside Ashcamp, Kentucky, I stop beside the road in disbelief, as I encounter an entire hillside of fighting cocks. Each bird is tethered to a small coop, the tethers just short enough to prevent the birds from reaching each other. In plain sight, fighting cocks, but that's illegal, isn't it? </p>

<p>Fearing somewhat for my life and not wanting to appear as if I'm "investigating," I slip a pair of inconspicuous (i.e., stealth) Core-sound binaural microphones onto my eyeglasses and simply stand beside the road, facing in the opposite direction, faithfully capturing the crows of this rooster village across the road behind me.</p>

<p>Hear the individual voices in these roosters, especially obvious in the four birds during the ten seconds beginning at 1:28. </p>

<p>Later, just a few miles down the road, I'd be told that it's not illegal to raise fighting cocks, only to fight them. And, with a smile, my friend added that "Everyone in eastern Kentucky's into something illegal--you just don't know what it is." </p>
