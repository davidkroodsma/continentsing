<p>Nearly seven minutes of real time from the Pacific shore.</p>

<p>Nothing takes me there more than the long calls of western gulls at Seal Rock headland, over the roar of the surf below. Add the calls of oystercatchers and guillemots to the soundscape and, well, this is <em>The Pacific</em>.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Black oystercatchers (1:10), pigeon guillemots with high wheezy voices on occasion (e.g., 0:57, 3:02-3:20).</p>
