<p>One Townsend's warbler is in the foreground, a second in the background, both singing the local dawn song, typically with two short <em>zweee</em> notes, a much louder and longer <em>ZWEEEEE</em>, followed by the two loud concluding <em>TSCHEW</em> notes: </p>

<p><em>zwee zwee ZWEEEEE TSCHEW TSCHEW</em>.</p>

<p>Listen to the vigorous chipping of the foreground bird, with singles, doubles, and even triple chips, up to 20 or so total chips between songs, which are delivered at a rate of about nine per minute. </p>

<p>Compare the dawn singing of the closely related black-throated green warbler back East (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-61">VA-61</a>), and you'll hear a similar energy.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Varied thrush, another Townsend's warbler, Swainson's thrush, western tanager</p>
