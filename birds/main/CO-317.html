<p>A hyperactive male red-winged blackbird. He flies about me, almost within arm's reach, reacting strongly to my presence, and he calls beautifully. I have heard many red-winged blackbirds in my day, songs and calls, but these are the most beautiful calls that I've ever heard. </p>

<p>And how different these calls are from other dialects that we've heard across the country. These calls <em>are</em> the local dialect, to be sure, as another male can be heard in the background giving the same intense, slurred, tonal whistles that the focal male is giving (listen at 0:04, 0:09, 0:13; then, for a different call, at 0:18, 0:22).</p>

<p>Feast your ears on the variety of unique calls in this dialect. In so doing, you'll never listen to a marsh of red-winged blackbirds again, as you'll inevitably be listening far more carefully to the calls wherever you travel.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Brown-headed cowbird, other red-winged blackbirds, western meadowlark, common yellowthroat.</p>
