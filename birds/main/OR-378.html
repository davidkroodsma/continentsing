<p>My spotted towhee sings five songs, and nearly 40 minutes after I last listened to him he has returned to sing one of the songs I heard from him before (see <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-374">OR-374</a>). I enjoy the towhee, but it is the American crow who flies by during the fourth song who grabs my attention (6-7 wing beats/sec). </p>

<p>I let the towhee sing one more song before swinging the parabolic microphone over to the crow, who shuffles on the perch, keeping balance, then <em>caw</em>s. In his fourth series (beginning at 1:13), he launches, cawing on the wing and fading into the distance, where he offers one more cawing triplet before going silent. These <em>caw</em>s are nothing like the robust <em>caw</em>ing I expect from crows in the continent's interior.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Brown-headed cowbird, American robin, and the foghorn at Newport with the sound of distant surf at South Beach State Park.  </p>
