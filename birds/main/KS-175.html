<p>A western kingbird in dawn song. From his perch he sputters and bickers a nearly continuous <em>kip kip kip ki-PIP</em>, single <em>kip</em> notes followed by an occasional double <em>ki-PIP</em>, with a strong emphasis on the <em>PIP</em>, and every few seconds he delivers a flourish of longer and louder notes, <em>ki-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP</em>, the emphasis strong at first and then trailing off. He had been singing here for perhaps 15 minutes before I caught up with him, and he sings for only two more minutes before flying off at 2:18 to sing elsewhere.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Ring-necked pheasant crow (best heard during the first second), eastern kingbird, great crested flycatcher awakes at 1:41.</p>
