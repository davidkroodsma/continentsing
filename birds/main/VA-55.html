<p>A second least flycatcher (neighbor of the male singing in <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-54">VA-54</a>) races through his song repertoire, also delivering everything he knows in just a little over a tenth of a second, in a single <em>cheBEK</em>. He pauses a little over half a second and dumps all he knows again, and again, and again, also at a clip of about 70 <em>cheBEK</em> per minute, with short bursts at the rate of nearly 90 songs/minute. </p>

<p>Here is the essence of his dawn performance, one <em>cheBEK</em> after another delivered at breakneck speed.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A second least flycatcher. Other birds heard in the background are an American robin, dark-eyed junco, mourning dove, tufted titmouse. One rather special, distant bird is a wild turkey gobbling (e.g., 0:16, 0:53).</p>
