<p>We have heard the summer tanagers calling and singing from the Atlantic through the Ozarks, throughout the East. This particular bird calls late afternoon in a park in downtown Ellington, Missouri. Its the standard <em>pit-i-tuck</em>, though rather extended, with the number of <em>tuck</em>s greater than usual. In general, he sounds annoyed or distressed about something, though only he knows what is on his mind.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>American robin (calls), mourning dove, great crested flycatcher, loud jet, Carolina wren (calls), blue jay.</p>
