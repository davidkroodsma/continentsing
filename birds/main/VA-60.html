<p>Several series of slow <em>yenk-yenk-yenk-yenk-yenk</em> calls from a red-breasted nuthatch, with three to six <em>yenk</em> calls in each of about nine series. But hear the variety in his voice, how the series are slower and more drawn out at the end. Very expressive, very nice.</p>

<p>Wind picks up a bit at times, surging through the spruce overhead. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Quite prominent are the nine songs of a brown creeper (see also <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-59">VA-59</a>) off to the right and the dawn chipping and singing of the black-throated green warbler nearby (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-61">VA-61</a>). More distant are the occasional caws of an American crow and the singing of a winter wren (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-57">VA-57</a>). The wind howls through the trees here on top of the mountain.  </p>
