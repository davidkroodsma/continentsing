<p>This field sparrow is fired up! Hes into the dawn chorus, using his complex dawn song, which consists of four different phrases; call them A, B, C, and D. But, as in the first song, he cant seem to stop after an A B C D sequence; instead, he gives two extra phrases, so that the song is A B C D B C. </p>

<p>The next song is A B C D, then A B C, and then (at 0:33) he chips frantically before the next song, which is an A B C D B C again. Those chips are reminiscent of the dawn effort of the Brewers sparrow, a closely related species in the genus <em>Spizella</em>. Overall, its quite a performance by this field sparrow.</p>

<p>How different these dawn songs are from the leisurely daytime bouncing ball songs (VA-19, VA-20, VA-21, KY-93).</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Lots of eastern towhees! Indigo bunting, wind.</p>
