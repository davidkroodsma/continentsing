<p>Here is my favorite yellow-breasted chat of all time. Early on he offers three sounds that I soon hear frequently. The first sound (at 0:01) is a harsh raspy phrase, somewhat frog-like. Then, after a three-note song, at 0:09 he offers both the <em>BOB</em> and the <em>WHITE</em> of the northern bobwhite song, or so it sounds to me. Whether or not he actually learned them from a bobwhite is impossible to know, but what I value most is that I can recognize them and hear them when he uses them again. </p>

<p>And sure enough, those three sounds comprise about half of his singing effort <em>until</em> he introduces an entirely new package of songs, at 7:14. He gives his last frog-like song at 7:01, the last BOB-WHITE! combination by 7:13, and then it's out with the old and in with the new. Try your ears at recognizing all of the new sounds that he introduces here.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A second yellow-breasted chat on a neighboring territory, purple martins in dawn song flight, barred owl (beginning at 2:41), a single song from an indigo bunting who stirs on his night perch, and eventually a summer tanager in dawn song (about 7:30).</p>
