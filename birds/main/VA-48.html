<p>Like a metronome, this ovenbird delivers his crescendo song, each song building in intensity through to the final phase. Its a <em>teacher</em> song all right, but the <em>te</em> is so brief and relatively soft that the song is dominated by the emphatic, down-slurred <em>CHER</em>, sounding like a series of <em>t-CHER</em> phrases.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A pileated woodpecker drums in the distance initially, with distant black-throated blue warbler, hermit thrush, scarlet tanager, chestnut-sided warbler. </p>
