<p>A spotted towhee in dawn mode, eager, it would seem, to tell everything he knows in as short a time as possible. These arent the standard <em>drink-your-teeeeeee</em> songs of the eastern towhee, with only two or three distinct introductory notes followed by a trill of rapidly repeated phrases. Instead, most of these songs consist of two to eight identical <em>drink</em> notes followed by a faster trill.</p>

<p>If I letter the songs by the minute, I come up with the following:</p>

<p>A B C D B C D B C B (the first two B songs are incomplete)</p>

<p>B C B B B B C B</p>

<p>C E C B C F C E B</p>

<p>B C B C B E C B E</p>

<p>Successive songs are usually different, though immediate repetition of song B occurs during the second minute. He has a repertoire of at least six different songs (A-F), more than would be expected of an eastern towhee, not quite as many as a west coast spotted towhee might have.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Gray flycatcher, western tanager, both in dawn song.</p>
