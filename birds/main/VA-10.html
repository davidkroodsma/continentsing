<p>What a wonderful variety of sounds from these jays! 
A single blue jay starts it off during the first five seconds with four well-spaced <em>jay</em> calls: <em>jay jay jay jay</em>, all of a particular duration and tonal quality. Within a second after he finishes, off to the right two to three other jays respond; from 0:08 to 0:14, hear how these jays are all using identical <em>jay</em> calls. Sometimes the jays call alternately (e.g., 0:07, 0:13), sometimes more sloppily overlapping (0:09), sometimes almost perfectly synchronized (0:11). Such coordinated use of the same <em>jay</em> calls doesnt happen by chance: Given the seemingly infinite variety of calls these birds are capable of, its clear that theyre being very selective in what they are saying to each other here.</p>

<p>I love the sequence from 0:28 to 0:51. In just 23 seconds, the jays give a brief primer on the variety of sounds that they can make, beginning with a fine rendition of a squeaky gate and ending emphatically with a blue jay flying by in plain view, exclaiming something no doubt significant with five double jay calls: <em>jay-jay jay-jay jay-jay jay-jay jay-jay</em>. And then all is silent, except for a few more double jay calls as they fly into the distance.</p>

<p>And, to top it all off, a pair of yellow-billed cuckoos add a little duet at the end (1:28; use headphones to hear this best). A bird off to the right begins the song, <em>ca ca ca ca ca</em> . . . and soon after a bird to the left chimes in, <em>ca ca ca ca ca</em>, the two of them now calling together. Only the bird to the right finishes the sequence, the four seconds of <em>ca ca ca ca ca ca</em> ending with four seconds of <em>kowlp kowlp kowlp kowk</em>.</p>
