<p>The persistent daytime <em>zee zee zee zee zee zoo zree</em> of a black-throated green warbler, with almost always five tonal <em>zee</em> notes, followed by a single low tonal <em>zoo</em> note, then the buzzy <em>zree</em> on the end. Well into the morning now he utters no chips between songs, well after hes abandoned his <em>zree zree zoo zoo zree</em> dawn song (see VA-61). </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>The persistent singing of a golden-crowned kinglet (see OR-337). And, at 1:57, every so faintly, what sounds like the single call of a Swainson's thrush! </p>
