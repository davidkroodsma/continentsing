<p>A blue-winged warbler in dawn song. When really excited, he'll chip regularly between songs, but there's only a hint of a chip here and there in this somewhat uninspired performance (a single chip at 0:53). </p>

<p>But it surely is the dawn song, not the <em>beee-bzzzzzz</em> song expected later in the day. This dawn song begins with a few stuttered notes and ends in a buzzy trill, similar in quality to the ending of the daytime song. </p>

<p>You can hear his daytime <em>beee-bzzzzzz</em> song in <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-77">VA-77</a></p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Northern cardinal, indigo bunting, hooded warbler (also in dawn song), American robin, mourning dove, red-eyed vireo, distant dogs.</p>
