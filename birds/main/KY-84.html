<p>Listen to the local human dialect in the voice and wisdom of Mary Lou Napier, self-professed hillbilly from Hazard, Kentucky, camping at Buckhorn State Park, enjoying the peace and quiet of an evening by the fire. I could have excerpted this conversation and limited it to a minute or so, but I let Mary Lou have her say, for 15 minutes: </p>

<p>My name is Mary Lou Napier, and Im from Hazard, Kentucky, and were down at Buckhorn at the park, and it is beautiful, and we got a fire going, and were just listening to the birds, the sounds . . . I just like to hear em . . . hummingbirds . . . I just like birds, period. . . . the cardinal, oh, its just a beautiful bird, a red bird . . . birds are fascinating . . . even these poor ugly buzzards, off in the distance theyre pretty . . . that was beautiful, that was beautiful . . . I like birds, I like to watch them . . . I drive a school bus . . . I just love to listen to them . . . people call us hillbillies . . . a hillbilly is a friendly person, though. We might be hillbillies, but we got it made down here. We got all of this to listen to . . . in the cities you know, you dont have this . . . listen, this you dont find in the cities. Thats why I love Kentucky . . . very nice [Pileated Woodpecker calls]--you wont hear that in the cities . . . you probably have a lot of pigeons pooping on everything, but not that . . . you [we hillbillies] work hard, you dont get rich, but, you know, its the mornings and evenings . . . birds, trees, beautiful, its great . . .
