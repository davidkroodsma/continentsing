<p>Seven daytime songs from a second Brewer's sparrow (see also <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-219">ID-219</a>). As is typical, the song is two-parted, with the first phrase buzzy, the second part of more slowly repeated syllables. For this male, the first part is lower than the second, something like <em>zirrrrrrrrrrrrrr zee zee zee zee zee zee zee</em>. </p>

<p>Listening to the songs of the Brewer's sparrow at dawn (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-215">CO-215</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-216">CO-216</a>) and througout the day (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-219">ID-219</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-220">ID-220</a>), one can hardly believe they're the same species. </p>
