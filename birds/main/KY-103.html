<p>Starlings accompanied us all across the continent, but in the East they always eluded my microphone, hence this example taken from Michigan.</p>

<p>He starts slowly, as all starlings do, with slurred whistles, these not sounding quite like the standard red-tailed hawk or eastern wood-pewee, but bracketing the downslurs are imitations of what sound like American robin or hairy or downy woodpecker (0:06 to 0:11).</p>

<p>From 0:15 to 0:19 is a truly special section in which this starling uses his two voice boxes to simultaneously imitate a flicker's <em>wik-wik-wik</em> song and an eastern phoebe's <em>fee-bee</em> song.  </p>

<p>From 0:21-0:23, he offers two sandhill crane calls, followed immediately by two renditions of a <em>hey-sweetie</em> song of a black-capped chickadee, both the crane and chickadee mimicry occurring simultaneously with sounds produced by the other voice box.</p>

<p>There's far more going on in this extraordinary song, but those highlights are enough to enthrall almost anyone about this little-appreciated singer. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A vesper sparrow.</p>
