<p>Spotted towhees, lots of them, at least five audible in this recording. The foreground bird sings clearly, repeating one of his songs eight times before switching to a new one (at 0:52), which he then offers seven times (for a singing program here of 8A 7B). The near bird in the background alternates two songs throughout. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>An American robin singing constantly.</p>
