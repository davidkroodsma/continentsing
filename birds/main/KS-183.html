<p>Three northern flickers joust in the dead snags at the Quivira refuge. One in the background initially sings the <em>wik-wik-wik</em> song, overlapped by loud <em>flicka-flicka-flicka</em> calls of a second bird. Ten seconds later half-hearted <em>flicka-flicka</em> calls are followed by a drum, lasting a second and a half, at the rate of about 22 raps per second. </p>

<p>I listen well beyond this half minute: As birds in the background carry on, especially a mourning dove, American robin, and a great crested flycatcher, these three flickers fly about the tree, occasionally singing, calling, drumming, and chasing each other.</p>
