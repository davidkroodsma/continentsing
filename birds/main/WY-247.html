<p>A western tanager, over and over he calls, <em>pit-er-ick</em>, a dry, quarter-second, rising rattle; finally, after two and a half minutes, he offers three song phrases. We think these tanagers call like this when they're perturbed in some way, though what it is that he's fussing about is unclear.</p>

<p><em>Pit-er-ick</em>. One finds a mnemonic and then tends to be done with it. Yes, he's calling, <em>pit-er-ick</em>. But step beyond that and listen to how he enunciates this simple call time after time. Maybe the first call in this selection is <em>pit-er-ick</em>, but the second call is more like <em>pit-er-eek</em>, the last syllable higher and less harsh. The third call also ends with a tonal note, but it is lower than that of the second call. </p>

<p>There's a lot going on in these simple calls, and I wish I knew what was on the mind of this tanager as he varied his calls in this way. Perhaps nothing was on his mind, I realize is one possibility, but when I see variation like this, I tend to think the bird knows what he is doing and has a reason for it all. </p>
