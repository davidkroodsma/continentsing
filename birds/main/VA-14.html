<p>From our Jamestown Beach Campground, near the relatively noisy Colonial Parkway (auto traffic in background), a chipping sparrow sings at dawn on an access road through the campground. He sings at a rate of 30 brief songs per minute, each song a half to a full second in duration, the pauses between songs about as long as the songs themselves. His neighbor sings nearby, also on the ground and just a few yards away from him, so we soon train the microphone on him next, surprised to hear that he sings a very similar song (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-15">VA-15</a>).</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>American robin, northern cardinal, and others.</p>
