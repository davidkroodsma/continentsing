<p>Yes, what a mimic he is. I catch glimpses of his skills, with some mimicry blatant, other bits of it subtle so that I'm often not sure what he's up to. Here I list what strikes me as I listen:</p>

<p>0:03, house sparrow</p>

<p>0:30, northern flicker <em>Klee-yer!</em> call</p>

<p>0:50, purple martin</p>

<p>1:10, blue jay</p>

<p>1:47, common yellowthroat</p>

<p>2:00, common yellowthroat </p>

<p>2:07, great crested flycatcher</p>

<p>2:14, northern flicker <em>Klee-yer!</em> call</p>

<p>2:21, blue jay</p>

<p>2:37, Carolina wren</p>

<p>2:48, northern cardinal</p>

<p>2:56, Carolina wren</p>

<p>3:07, eastern bluebird</p>

<p>3:20, purple martin?</p>

<p>3:29, blue jay</p>

<p>3:47, wood thrush</p>

<p>4:18, northern cardinal</p>

<p>4:27, tufted titmouse</p>

<p>5:01, northern flicker <em>Klee-yer!</em> call</p>

<p>5:04, blue jay </p>

<p>5:12, killdeer?</p>

<p>5:32, eastern phoebe!  <em>fee-bee</em> song</p>

<p>6:04, great crested flycatcher?</p>

<p>6:16, belted kingfisher?</p>

<p>6:19, wood thrush</p>

<p>6:27, common yellowthroat</p>

<p>6:40, purple martin</p>

<p>6:48, blue jay</p>

<p>6:53, house finch</p>

<p>7:01, tufted titmouse</p>

<p>Some of this mimicry is striking, leaving no doubt, such as the variety of calls from blue jays, the <em>Klee-yer!</em> call of the northern flicker, the <em>wichity</em> song of a common yellowthroat, the <em>whit-whit</em> calls of a wood thrush, the <em>FEE-bee</em> of an eastern phoebe. Others are less obvious to me, and a host of his songs sound so familiar, yet I can't quite place them. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Perhaps an ovenbird and scarlet tanager, but the northern mockingbird is so overpowering that little can be heard beyond him . . . other than distant traffic noise in this densely populated section of eastern Virginia.</p>
