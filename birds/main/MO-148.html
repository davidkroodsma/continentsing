<p>I always wonder what's in the head of these yellow-throated vireos. Why do some birds sing one song over and over, others alternate two obviously different songs, and others sing in more complex ways.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to hear what this bird is doing, until one studies the sonagrams, which I of course have done.</p>

<p>He seems to have two packages of songs, as indicated by the following sequence of songs (in half-minute blocks):</p>

<p>A B C A B D E F G H</p>

<p>F G H F G H D E F G H</p>

<p>D E F G H D F G H D E</p>

<p>F G H D E F G H D F I? B</p>

<p>C A B C A . . .</p>

<p>One package of songs consists of songs A, B, and C (underlined), which he delivers first and last in this sequence. Mostly, he sings his five-song package of D, E, F, G, and H. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Carolina wren, tufted titmouse, indigo bunting, American crow, purple martin, wild turkey (at end). The tufted titmouse in the background sings the same song throughout, never switching.</p>
