<p>Two kingfishes, male and female, conversing in kingfisher rattles. First to arrive is the female; she calls a few times, until the male arrives (about 0:25). They continue their banter, flying among the branches on the dead tree lying in the river, until they've had their say and then fly off. </p>

<p>A few Canada geese in the distance</p>
