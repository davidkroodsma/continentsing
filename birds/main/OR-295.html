<p>A common yellowthroat sings <em>witchity-wichity-wichity</em>, in slow motion it seems, though he doesn't have the mnemonic quite right, as he sings more of a <em>y-wichy y-wichy y-wichy</em>. Ten songs over two minutes, a song every 12 seconds, on average, at a leisurely pace.</p>

<p>When in unfamiliar territory, I always hear sounds I don't know. Here is a mystery "double bark," best heard beginning at 0:31 through 1:16. Or is it a "double quack"? I'm just not sure. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Barn swallow, tree swallow, great horned owl (who has last say, to 2:12), barking sounds, pied-billed grebe, red-winged blackbird, yellow-headed blackbird, miscellaneous water birds.</p>
