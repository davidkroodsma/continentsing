<p>A common nighthawk patrolling its territory at dawn. As he circles about, he calls <em>peent . . .peent . . . peent</em> . . . faster than one every two seconds. Just barely can we follow his erratic flight, and then he dives sharply, <em>VROOM</em>ing loudly at the bottom of his dive. In this four minute segment, he dives and <em>VROOM</em>s ten times, about once every 25 seconds, <em>peent</em>ing ten to 12 times between successive dives.</p>

<p>The <em>peent</em>s of a nearby common nighthawk can on occasion be heard in the background, as during the first ten seconds; even more distant <em>VROOM</em>s are heard, because the low-frequency booming sound carries so much farther than the higher <em>peeent</em>s (e.g., 0:13, 0:17, though both are partially masked by the foreground <em>peent</em>; better heard at 0:51, when two males can be heard in the distance, the first off to the right, the second to the left). </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Wind, ring-necked pheasant, western kingbird, western meadowlark, and an early morning breeze whistling through the sage.</p>
