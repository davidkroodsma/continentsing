<p>A worm-eating warbler, far less frenzied now than when I was listening to him earlier this morning, but he's come closer now, and he still chips occasionally between songs (listen to the chips before the first five songs). </p>

<p>But to hear him when he was in full stride during the dawn chorus was quite something. His animated chipping filled all time between songs, there being no doubt about the intensity conveyed in his voice. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Acadian flycatcher, eastern phoebe, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, a 2nd worm-eating warbler (who also chips occasionally between songs), Carolina wren, yellow-billed cuckoo, indigo bunting, dogs, great crested flycatcher, and the inevitable highway noise rising up from the valley below. </p>
