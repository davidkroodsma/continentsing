<p>What a remarkable variety of songs this mixed-up chickadee sings! He is the kind of singer that one might expect to hear in a true hybrid zone between black-capped chickadees and Carolina chickadees.</p>

<p>In every song, one hears traces of typical black-capped chickadee songs (<em>hey-sweetie</em>) or typical Carolina Chickadee songs (with alternating high and low notes), or both. </p>

<p>Take the first song: He begins with a typical <em>hey-sweetie</em>, but then adds a second <em>sweetie</em>, lower than the first. The second song alternates hi and low elements like a typical Carolina chickadee song, but it's longer than expected, with six elements; the third song is the same, but adds part of a seventh element. He plays with those two song forms until 0:29, when he delivers a typical <em>hey-sweetie</em> of a black-capped chickadee, the entire song pitch-shifted from the <em>hey-sweetie</em> elements of before. So he has not only the song forms of the black-capped chickadee but the pitch-shifting behavior as well. </p>

<p>At 0:37, he combines a higher-pitched <em>hey-sweetie</em> of a black-capped chickadee with the alternating elements of a Carolina chickadee, all in one song, a clear hybrid song.</p>

<p>And at 0:54, as is evident in the sonagrams but not so easily to the naked ear, he introduces a second form of the hi-low song of a Carolina chickadee. Next (at 0:58) is the high note of a Carolina chickadee song followed by a typical <em>hey-sweetie</em> on a much lower frequency, another hybrid song. </p>

<p>At 2:42 is a beautiful <em>hey-sweetie</em> song, but then listen to the next song. It is a hi-lo-hi-lo version of a Carolina chickadee song, but the last low note is actually a double note, like a sweetie, so it's <em>hi-low-hi-sweetie</em>, yet another fine hybrid song.</p>

<p>He throws in a few gargle notes, too, notes that are given in aggressive encounters and often interspersed with the whistled songs during the dawn chorus (e.g., three times between 2:20 and 2:30). </p>

<p>What a bird! Standing in the contact zone between the ranges of the Carolina chickadee and the black-capped chickadee, this is exactly the kind of behavior that I have read I should encounter here. </p>
