<p>Two jewels singing side by side, a rose-breasted grosbeak and a Baltimore oriole, both in plain sight up in the dead snag. </p>

<p>The grosbeak sings as he does, with the listener never knowing what particular sequence of his clear notes is to come. </p>

<p>The oriole is more predictable. His piping song overlaps that of the grosbeak initially; then he gives his typical chatter (beginning at 0:19), and finally sings in the clear at 0:35; he repeats that song version at 0:43, 0:53, and 1:10, but then at 1:18 offers a different tune. Further examples of those two song patterns occur until he is last heard at 2:22, leaving the grosbeak all to himself.</p>

<p>I'm curious about the grosbeak in the background. These are the Great Plains, after all, and in these plains are hybrid grosbeaks bearing characteristics of both the rose-breasted grosbeak of the East and the black-headed grosbeak of the West. I never saw the second grosbeak, so will just have to remain curious as to what he looked like. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Mourning dove, frogs, red-bellied woodpecker, another grosbeak in the background (about 2:10), blue jay.</p>
