<p>A fox sparrow. I like the last two notes on the third song (C)--they sound much like the <em>piik piik</em> notes of an American robin. I hear that song four times among the 14 songs here, and a study of the sonagrams shows that he sings in the sequence A B C B D C B A C D B A B C.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Dark-eyed juncos, sapsucker drum (e.g., 0:17, 0:54) and calls (e.g.,  1:50), <em>Empidonax</em> (1:00), hermit thrush, wind off the Cascades</p>
