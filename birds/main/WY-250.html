<p>A barn swallow singing beside the boathouse at Jenny Lake; in the background is the roar of Cottonwood Creek that empties Jenny Lake in Teton National Park. Initially I am walking, searching for him, and there he is! Mid-way through the first song I get the microphone aimed at him, and he next offers a partial song and then two more complete songs, the first, third, and last songs all with the characteristic ending, the finger-over-the-comb rattle. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Yellow warbler, mountain chickadee, warbling vireo, yellow-rumped warbler.</p>
