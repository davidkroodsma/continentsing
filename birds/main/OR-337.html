<p>A golden-crowned kinglet singing in the wind, the branches of the pines creaking as they sway. True to expectation, he sings a high, thin series of rising tonal notes, from about 7000 Hz up to 8500 Hz, then drops down to a sharp chatter between 4000 and 7000 Hz. In the upper registers he offers a fine test of ones hearing.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Wind through the Ponderosa pine, and a warbler at 0:19 and 0:29. But just which warbler is it??</p>
