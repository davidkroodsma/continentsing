<p>Bewick's wren, with nine songs. All are of the same type, the fourth song type that I've recorded from this male this morning. The average male wren on the Finley National Wildlife Refuge would have at least a dozen more that he's not yet sung during these four examples. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Swainson's thrush, spotted towhee, common yellowthroat, American goldfinch, orange-crowned warbler, tree swallow.</p>
