<p>Just 10 yards away, a gray flycatcher sings from low in a juniper, a yard or so off the ground. </p>

<p>His two songs are obvious: <em>chu-WIP, chu-WIP, chu-WIP, teeah</em>, with two to five rough <em>chu-WIP</em>s before he seems to complete his thoughts with the higher, tonal <em>teeah</em>, and then he starts all over. </p>

<p>He sings at the rate of about two songs every three seconds, a song every second and a half, about 42 songs in this one-minute sample.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Chipping sparrow, American robin, spotted towhee. </p>
