<p>A western warbling vireo, singing beside the bicycle hostel in Dubois, Wyoming. I left the recorder here, aiming up into the tree, to capture whatever was on this birds mind.</p>

<p>What is it about these songs that are so different from those of the eastern bird (IL-124)? My first impression is that these songs are shorter than a good eastern song. These western songs do have highs and lows, and the high notes are typically the loudest, but the rhythm is so fast, with the song rising and falling so abruptly from one phrase to the next that it doesnt give the same gentle, undulating feeling as does the eastern song. </p>

<p>The standard mnemonic just doesnt seem to apply to this western warbling vireo, as its difficult to hear from this bird <em>If I SEES you, I will SEIZE you, and Ill SQUEEZE you till you SQUIRT!</em> </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Squirrel, ruby-crowned kinglet, red-breasted nuthatch, mountain chickadee, olive-sided flycatcher</p>
