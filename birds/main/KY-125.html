<p>Nine sharp PEET-sah songs from an Acadian flycatcher. He's in daytime mode, singing at a leisurely pace of about five songs per minute.</p>

<p>On occasion throughout the night, as if he's restless for the dawn, this song also explodes from his night roost. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Ovenbird (8 songs throughout), blue-gray gnatcatcher, tufted titmouse, purple martin, red-bellied woodpecker. Some rain dripping from the trees.</p>
