<p>A sage thrasher at dawn. For openers, he offers a song that takes a minute and ten seconds to finish. He pauses at most ten seconds, and hes singing again, but this time for only half a minute. His longest is about a minute and 20 seconds. </p>

<p>I dont hear a lot of mimicry, though every once in a while theres a California quail (0:32, 0:45, 1:23, 1:48, 3:34, 6:45--and more, Im sure, as I made no concerted effort to find them all; perhaps you can find others). At 3:18 theres a nice imitation of a female red-winged blackbirds call. Almost certainly a willet at 5:00. </p>

<p>Another sage thrasher, Wilson's snipe, western meadowlark, American coot, Brewer's sparrow, sora, yellow-headed blackbird, savannah sparrow.</p>
