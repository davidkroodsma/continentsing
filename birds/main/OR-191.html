<p>Nearly five minutes of uninterrupted house finch song. High-spirited and lively they are, with the occasional husky, hoarse notes on the end of the song. I search for patterns, wondering how he puts the performance together, and soon see in the sonagrams some of his method.</p>

<p>The patterns are messy, as he seems to rearrange his song components so that he has a great variety of songs. Nevertheless, I persevere, and when I look at the first three minutes, I see a pattern that looks like this:</p>

<p>Minute 1: A B C C B B C A B</p>

<p>Minute 2: A C A A A B D A B C</p>

<p>Minute 3: A C B D C C D C A</p>

<p>I see four basic patterns, but wonderful variety is introduced by delivering incomplete songs (e.g., the first song B at 0:08 is only a fragment of the next song B at 0:26), and some flourishes here and there. Minute 4, I confess, got even messier, so I stopped after three.</p>

<p>Im not sure I wanted to know all of that detail, because Im not sure just a few minutes is enough to characterize what all this house finch does. But I know enough to keep me happy until I encounter the next one. </p>
