<p>This American robin is on a tear, delivering roughly two songs per second, 120 per minute, leaving me breathless just listening to him as he greets the day with his dawn singing. At 1:22 he begins a two-second pause, and at 2:05 he pauses for a little over a second, but other than that he doesnt miss a beat. He consistently offers a few low carols punctuated by one to three higher hisselly phrases, on and on, though admittedly sometimes its hard to tell which kind of phrase is which.</p>

<p>You can play the robin game of listening for a distinctive phrase if you wish. I chose the two-note whistled phrase at 0:28 and listened for it to recur, finding it in three clusters:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>0:28, 0:32.5, 0:39.5, 0:48.5, 0:53.5, 0:59.5 (0:28 to 0:59)</p></li>
<li><p>1:25.5, 1:31.5, 1:34.5, 1:41.5 (1:25 to 1:41)</p></li>
<li><p>1:59.5, 2:03, 2:08.5 (1:59 to 2:08)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As with other robins, he sings in packages, giving one of his carols several times among others, then abandoning that carol until some time later, when he reintroduces it.</p>

<p>Wilson's snipe winnowing, yellow warbler, sandhill crane bugles (2:04).</p>
