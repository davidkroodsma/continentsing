<p>In the dense hedge beside the road, with the cattle just beyond, just listen to this flock of <em>chirrup</em>ing and chattering House Sparrows! Listen to just the first few seconds and perhaps you've had enough, but I let them carry on here for over four minutes.</p>

<p>(OK, I sneaked this recording in from just off the bike route in Colorado; it was just too good and too typical of what we heard in so many places from our bicycles, but I never managed to record the birds well on the bike route itself.)</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>cattle, mourning dove, ring-necked pheasant (0:32), wind. </p>
