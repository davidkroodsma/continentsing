<p>This dark-eyed junco sings from several rhododendron thickets here in the understory on the flanks of Mt. Rogers; four samples of his singing over about 45 minutes revealed four different songs in his repertoire. </p>

<p>In this selection, Ive chosen five renditions from each of the four different types, for a total of 20 songs, so that he sings 5 A songs, 5 B, 5 C, and then 5 D songs. Please realize, however, that hed rarely sing in this way, with so few renditions of a given song type before switching to another.</p>

<p>In another session, this junco repeated one of these four songs, but its possible that he can sing an additional song or two, though six is about the largest song repertoire a junco from Virginia would be expected to have. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Canada warbler, American robin, veery, black-throated blue warbler, hooded warbler.</p>
