<p>The daytime singing of a black-and-white warbler. Its a high, thin, piercing song of see-sawing couplets, two notes alternated here seven to eight times. <em>Weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee</em> he sings, with a strong accent on the <em>wee</em>, the <em>see</em> higher and softer. Or perhaps you hear <em>squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky</em>, much like rubbing a wet rag over glass. Whatever mnemonic you use, its a distinctive song. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Ovenbirds (2), red-eyed vireo, chipping sparrow, and a few flies.</p>
