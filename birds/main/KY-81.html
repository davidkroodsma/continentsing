<p>These two warblers are often heard together throughout the South. First up is the Kentucky warblers chortling <em>chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree</em>, followed immediately by the hooded warblers pure <em>weet-weet-weet-weeto</em>. They seem to share the airwaves, with the four songs of the Kentucky never overlapping the six of the hooded.</p>
