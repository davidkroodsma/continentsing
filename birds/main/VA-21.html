<p>From the bough of a pine tree hanging out over the road, a third field sparrow offers his unique tune. Each song is a gem, beginning with five or six tonal whistles, with successive whistles rising and lengthening; following that introductory phrase is an abrupt change to a rapid trill of down-slurred whistles, given with increasing tempo.</p>

<p>Seventeen songs over the five minutes that I listened to him makes for a leisurely pace of three to four songs per minute.</p>

<p>Listen to this male's two neighbors at <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-19">VA-19</a>, <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-20">VA-20</a>.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Rain. The summer tanager sings loudly nearby. Distant birds: Kentucky warbler, red-eyed vireo, common yellowthroat. </p>
