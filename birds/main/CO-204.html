<p>What more can I learn from this second broad-tailed hummingbird? </p>

<p>In the second of two bursts of wing sounds here (at 0:08), I measure 42 beats per second; great, I'm comfortable with that, as that's most likely his wing flapping rate during normal flying. That's consistent with my first conclusion based on the other recording (<a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-203">CO-203</a>).</p>

<p>But the first burst of wing sound is again more complex. At first the wing sounds occur at a rate of about 16 per second (5 beats/0.31 sec), and then jump to 43, which again is flying speed.</p>

<p>So it seems clear that he is perfectly capable of turning the wing sounds on and off as he flies. And I've learned that he can emphasize some beats and deemphasize others--at least I can't come up with another explanation. </p>

<p>Checking the experts, in the Birds of North America series I read that wing beats during normal flight are about 38 times/second, and up to 52 times/second when the hummingbird is hovering. We largely agree, but there remains some uncertainty about the apparent slower wing beats.</p>
