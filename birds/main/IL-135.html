<p>One of the sweetest chipping sparrow songs that one will hear. There's nothing dry and "chippy" about this song--no, it's a pure tone slurred lazily from about 8000 down to 3000 Hz, making it sound more mellow, more laid back, making it easy to count the number of notes in each song: 13, 15, 14, 14 . . .</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Carolina wren, American crow, American robin, northern cardinal, summer tanager calls, blue-gray gnatcatcher, cars and trucks on a nearby highway.</p>
