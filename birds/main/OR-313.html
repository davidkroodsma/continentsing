<p>A lazuli bunting above Hell's Canyon . . . though for some reason it just sounds all wrong, much too rapidly delivered, not like the laid-back songs of the indigo buntings that I am so much more familiar with. I doubt myself every time I hear one of these and say "lazuli bunting." </p>

<p>Perhaps it's actually something else? No, I see him there, with my own eyes, delivering these thirteen songs over two and a quarter minutes. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Yellow-breasted chat, black-billed magpie, mourning dove, raspy calls of European starlings mobbing a western screech-owl. </p>
