<p>Just 20 feet overhead in a pine tree sings an American robin--how fitting, given the end of the <em>American</em> Revolution here in Yorktown. His mood seems unchanging over these two minutes, as he consistently sings several low carols followed by either one high <em>hisselly</em> (e.g., 0:03-0:07) or just the low carols by themselves without the high note (four series of low carols from 0:17 to 0:33).</p>

<p>In what I call "deep listening," I pick a distinctive carol and listen for it to recur throughout his performance. I like that unique carol at 0:13, for example, a <em>whee-di-di-di</em> sung so fast that I can barely count the four syllables; I listen for it to recur, finding it again at 0:42, 0:43, and 0:50; again at 1:24 and 1:37. Like all robins, he sings in "packages," clustering several examples of one caroled song together during a brief time period before hustling on to other caroled songs in his repertoire.</p>

<p>Try to listen for the double carol at 0:09, 0:17, 0:25; again at 0:38; again at 1:03, 1:06, 1:12; and then you're on your own. How many more occurrences of that double carol do you find in these two minutes?</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>The expected assortment in the distance, including blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, chipping sparrow, common grackle, fish crow (prominent at 1:07), northern mockingbird, tufted titmouse. And a distant train, with whistle. </p>
