<p>Here is a pace typical of dawn singing for an eastern towhee, with 12 songs in this minute. He is just awaking, and no doubt will build to a more intense dawn chorus in which he will consistently alternate different songs. </p>

<p>Now, 45 minutes before sunrise, he sings in the following sequence: A A A B A B B B B B B B. The A song is a typical <em>drink-your-teeeee</em>, but the B song is more of a simplified <em>your-teeeee</em>, without the first introductory note. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>American robin, indigo bunting, another eastern towhee.</p>
