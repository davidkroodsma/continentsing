<p>How nice to listen in on a great crested flycatcher at dawn. 
He sings from just overhead, but in such a curious fashion: He alternates one or two low, nearly inaudible buzzy <em>twrp</em> notes with one or two much louder <em>wheeee-up</em> notes. To my ears, he seems to use two different kinds of <em>wheeee-up</em> notes, often alternating them; one is more drawn out with the second syllable a low tonal note (at 0:02, for example), the other a little briefer with the second syllable a higher raspy note (0:04).</p>

<p>Here's an interesting exercise. Try listening to  the following recording in which I've deleted all of the low <em>twrp</em> notes and all of the silent intervals between the <em>wheeee-up</em> notes. Now you hear all of the <em>wheeee-up</em> notes in rapid succession and can more clearly hear what seem to be these two different <em>wheeee-up</em> notes.</p>

<p>Then listen to the actual sequence from the bird once more and try to piece together in your head what he's doing in his head. You'll never listen to a great crested flycatcher in the same way again. </p>
