<p>In 30 seconds, one knows what this pewee is capable of doing, but I listened to its entire dawn chorus. Here are the 13 minutes that I recorded. </p>

<p>From beside our tent in Alder, Montana, at a clip of about 40 songs/minute, this bird delivers minute after minute throughout the dawn chorus. He typically alternates his two songs, <em>tswee-tee-teet</em> (A) and <em>bzeeyeer</em> (B), but occasionally also throws in a third song, a tonal tsweeeeeer (C, such as at 0:18, 1:20, 1:47, 2:17, 2:55,3:34, 3:54, 4:20, 4:36, and more). Id love to know more about that third sound.</p>

<p>Heres what he does during the first minute alone, in 30 second blocks:</p>

<p>B A A B A B A B A B A C B A B A B A B A</p>

<p>B A B A A B A B A B A A B A B A B A B A A B A</p>

<p>I find it curious that his longest pause, of three seconds, is when a car passes on the road. He quickly resumes his torrid pace, however.  </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Yellow warbler, Wilsons snipe, American robin; general hissy background noise of water and distant human-made noise, plus one vehicle passing.</p>
