<p>How can I resist sidling up to a yellow-breasted chat singing in the dark, when I can stand just a few yards away from the source of all of these good sounds emerging from the thick of a small bush? I can't.</p>

<p>I listen, dumbfounded at the variety of sounds he knows, smiling at 1:38 when he introduces a high <em>cheep</em> that sounds exactly like the call of a house sparrow. Whether the source of the sound is in fact a house sparrow or not, it does provide me with a nice handle on how to listen. He <em>cheep</em>s again at 2:08, 2:22, 2:39, a total of 20 times over five and a half minutes all the way to 7:03, and then it's gone! About there, at 6:55, he introduces a somewhat similar, but distinctly lower note, suggesting that around 7:00 he's leaving behind the package of songs with the house sparrow-like <em>cheep</em> and starting a whole new series of sounds. </p>

<p>As you listen, you'll hear other sounds in the first package that accompany the house sparrow <em>cheep</em>. I'll leave you on your own to detect other patterns in this chat's performance.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Willow flycatcher, bullfrogs and green frogs, mostly; eastern kingbird, barn swallow, another yellow-breasted chat, eastern bluebird (e.g., 5:44), in distance.</p>
