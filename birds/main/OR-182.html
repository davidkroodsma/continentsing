<p>A western black-capped chickadee, typical of most birds from Kansas west to the crest of the Cascades. </p>

<p>The fourth song (at 0:18) is especially sharp and clear, telling of the two-toned <em>hey-sweetie</em> that is the signature whistle of these birds almost everywhere. I say "almost" because just a few days ride to the west will reveal black-capped chickadees who know nothing of this song to which others of their kind conform. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Yellow warbler, black-billed magpie, American crow, mourning dove. </p>
