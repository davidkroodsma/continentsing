<p>Great horned owls, a whole family of them! The distant adult female hoots first (her <em>ho ho-ooo hooo hoo</em> in first two seconds), followed immediately (after a rising, tonal call by a Swainson's thrush) by a young owl who screeches from the oak trees about 100 yards away. She hoots again (0:09), and he screeches (0:13), but if you listen down low youll hear the distant foghorn hooting of the adult male, <em>ho ho-ooo hooo hoo</em>, typically immediately after the female (best heard at 0:47, 1:24, but hes also at 0:14 and 0:23) or before the female (0:56, 1:06)--youll probably have to turn the gain on the headphones up to hear him, but then dont let the youngster break your eardrums!  </p>
