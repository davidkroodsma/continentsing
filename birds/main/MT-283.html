<p>He perches on a fence post that runs through the open meadow here, offering the unique silhouette of a Wilson's snipe against the sky. </p>

<p>He calls, a rising crescendo, <em>TIK-TIK-TIK-TIK-TIK</em>, three series of them, then just after a minute lowers the volume to a soft two-syllable <em>a-TIK'-a-TIK'-a-TIK'-a-TIK'-a-TIK'</em>. </p>

<p>His expression is wonderfully varied, from loud TIK series to the softer <em>a-TIK'</em> calls. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>American robin, savannah sparrow (singing from the next fence post over from the snipe), winnowing snipe, least flycatcher, yellow warbler, western wood-pewee, some wind. </p>
