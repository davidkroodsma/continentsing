<p>Still another white-crowned sparrow of this local dialect. He sings from an aspen just a few feet away, 15 essentially identical songs over three minutes. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>American robin, an air-borne swallow (tree swallow?), sapsucker drums, ruffed grouse drum (0:59, 3:05--nice "eastern species"; with a second drumming grouse in the distance--best seen in sonagrams along the baseline, a challenge to actually hear), female elk in distance, mountain chickadee, ruby-crowned kinglet, MacGillivray's warbler, warbling vireo. </p>
