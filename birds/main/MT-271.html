<p>American robin, an air-borne swallow (tree swallow?), sapsucker drums, ruffed grouse drum (0:59, 3:05--nice "eastern species"; with a second drumming grouse in the distance--best seen in sonagrams along the baseline, a challenge to actually hear), female elk in distance, mountain chickadee, ruby-crowned kinglet, MacGillivray's warbler, warbling vireo. </p>
