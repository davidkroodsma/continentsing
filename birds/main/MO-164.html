<p>A Henslow's sparrow perches atop a small forb on the Regal Prairie trail at Prairie State Park, proudly, I would like to think, offering his half-second masterpiece to all who would hear. <em>Tsilick</em> doesn't do it justice, or <em>hiccup</em>, especially when the song is slowed down so that we can hear the details that the birds themselves no doubt hear.</p>

<p>I can hear the complaints: Over two minutes for this singer? Really? Why not play just a few songs and then move on to something more exciting? It's not in my nature to do so. </p>
