<p>He's known for having a song full of Z's, this black-throated gray warbler. I hear this male's version as <em>buzZEE buzZEE buzZEE buzZEE ZEE</em>, with four identical <em>buzZEE</em> song phrases followed by a higher-pitched <em>ZEE.</em> Hear how the song builds, too, the first <em>buzZEE</em> being rather soft, the last often the loudest, before the intense <em>ZEE</em> on the end. Eight songs in a minute and 20 seconds, at the daytime rate of six songs per minute. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Black-headed grosbeak, western wood-pewee, spotted towhee, lazuli bunting, purple finch, song sparrow, Bewick's wren.</p>
