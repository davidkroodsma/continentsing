<p>There, beside the road, a rock wren, and I catch just a few songs, but it is the sign of good things to come. Knowing how he delivers his songs, I listen intently, and catch him in the act. Its A B C A B here, and then hes done. </p>

<p>Just five songs, and three different ones out of the hundred or so he can sing, delivered in a typical rock wren pattern.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A bit of wind, distant birds.</p>
