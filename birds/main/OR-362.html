<p>A Pacific-slope flycatcher in dawn song, his three songs indistinguishable to my ears from his close relative the cordilleran flycatcher (actually, the debate is still raging as to whether the Pacific-slope and cordilleran flycatchers are separate species). </p>

<p>The first three songs are 1) the high, thin <em>seeet</em>, 2) the longish, two-syllable <em>ka-SLWEEP</em>, and 3) the harsher <em>pa-TIK</em>. In the first 30 seconds of this recording, he sings this <em>seeet, ka-SLWEEP, pa-TIK</em> sequence 11 times, as this is his favored sequence throughout the entire recording. Only once, at 0:38, does he insert an extra <em>ka-SLWEEP</em> into the sequence.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>American robin, Swainson's thrush, dark-eyed junco?</p>
