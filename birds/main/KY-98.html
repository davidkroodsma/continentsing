<p>A remarkable mimic, taking the calls of other birds and incorporating those calls into his songs.</p>

<p>The contents of this recording:</p>

<p>1) Frist 7 songs, from 0:00 to 0:34. These songs begin with four or five sharp <em>whit-whit</em> calls pilfered from a wood thrush. </p>

<p>2) Next 8 songs, 0:34 to 1:17. The second song type is easily distinguished from the others, but the mimicry in it is not so obvious to me.</p>

<p>3)  Last 9 songs, 1:17 to end. The mimicry here is special. The second note of this third song type is a prominent <em>wheeee-up</em> call of a great crested flycatcher; a split second later are what sounds like two <em>dee</em> calls from the <em>chick-a-dee-dee</em> of a Carolina chickadee (recognizable only when I isolated that part of the song and played those two notes by themselves); and toward the end are two sharp <em>whit-whit</em> notes of the wood thrush.</p>

<p>He has perhaps six to nine other songs he could sing as well, each one consisting largely of mimicry of other species, it seems.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Tufted titmouse, Carolina chickadee, northern cardinal, indigo bunting, red-bellied woodpecker, brown-headed cowbird, and rain falling from the trees after an overnight rain. </p>
