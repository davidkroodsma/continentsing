<p>Male and female blackbirds go about their business, singing and calling. </p>

<p>The male sings only three times in this selection, in the sequence A (at 0:04), B and B (at 1:05 and 1:46), the A song highly buzzy, the two B songs strongly pulsating. </p>

<p>Females call intensely, especially after the male's song; listen to the two females who call during and just after the first song, for example, and one female calls intensely after the last song, at 1:47.</p>

<p>And he <em>calls</em> as well, using a variety throughout. From 0:30 to 0:40, for example, you can hear four different calls given by the same male, all calls that are part of the local dialect here along the Mississippi River.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Carolina wren, dickcissel, orchard oriole, great crested flycatcher, eastern meadowlark, and barges along the Mississippi River idling as they wait for their load of coal </p>
