<p>This white-eyed vireo begins with four normal-sounding songs in A B A B sequence, the alternating sequence already indicating that hes a little worked up about something. Then he launches into a muted tirade in which hes deconstructed all of his songs into a stream of mimicry. The best I can do is to pick out the <em>whit whit</em> calls pilfered from the wood thrush, at 0:12, 0:31, 0:41, and more. </p>

<p>I dont know whats in his head, what caused all of this. Perhaps he had just encountered another male on his territory? I wish I knew. </p>
