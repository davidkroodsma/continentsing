<p>Its a hawk . . . no, wait, its a Steller's jay mimicking the asthmatic kee-eeee-arrr scream of a red-tailed hawk! The sound isnt quite asthmatic enough--its a little too pure and tonal for a red-tail, and not drawn out enough either. Also, a red-tail wouldnt call this frequently. As this bird emerged from the dense vegetation, its identity was clear, and especially when it proclaimed <em>shook shook shook</em> while flying away. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Lazuli bunting, orange-crowned warbler, western wood-pewee, another songbird at 0:11 that I dont quite recognize (jumbled song--warbling vireo?)</p>
