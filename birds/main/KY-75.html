<p>From atop a maple beside the road, this American redstart is in full dawn mode. He chips vigorously between songs, and in this one-minute sample sings three different songs in a somewhat unpredictable sequence: A B C A B C C A C C B. </p>

<p>He has another song that he hides now, but after the dawn chorus is over, he'll bring that one out, singing only it during more relaxed daytime singing. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Louisiana waterthrush, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee, wood thrush, white-eyed vireo</p>
