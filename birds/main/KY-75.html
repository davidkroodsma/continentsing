<p>From atop a maple beside the road, this American redstart is in full dawn mode. He chips vigorously between songs, and in this one-minute sample sings three different songs in a somewhat unpredictable sequence: A B C A B C C A C C B. </p>

<p>He has another song that he hides now, but after the dawn chorus is over, he'll bring that one out, singing only it during more relaxed daytime singing. You can hear that daytime style of repetitive singing in <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-79">VA-79</a></p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Louisiana waterthrush, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee, wood thrush, white-eyed vireo</p>
