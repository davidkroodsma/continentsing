<p>The same hooded warbler who was in dawn song earlier this morning now gives his daytime song, <em>weet-weet-weet-weeto</em>. At six to seven songs per minute, it's the same song over and over. The only detectable variation seems to be the number of <em>weet</em> notes before the ending <em>weeto</em>; having grown accustomed to three <em>weet</em> notes, the four in the song at 0:57 feels like quite a departure from the routine. </p>

<p>You can hear the dawn singing of this male in <a href="http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-76">VA-76</a></p>
