<p>A third gray flycatcher at dawn, neighbor to the other two (196, 197), singing <em>chu-WIP, chu-WIP, teeah</em> . . . </p>

<p>He has the expected two different songs that the gray flycatcher uses during his dawn singing, but he sings slowly, only about 24 songs/minute, much slower than his neighbor who can be heard in the background (see CO-195). In fact, about 0:50, the two other birds can be heard in the background, all three of these males singing in the dark at dawn, sight unseen.</p>
