<p>Seven daytime <em>bee-bzzzzzzz</em> songs of the blue-winged warbler, each song about a second and a half in duration. Notice how quiet the background is compared to the cacophony of the dawn chorus.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Ovenbird, hooded warbler, American crow, eastern towhee, red-bellied woodpecker, and a lone fly. </p>
