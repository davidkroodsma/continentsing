<p>OK, I got a little carried away here, but it is my nature. I needed to understand how this Hammond's flycatcher used his songs during the dawn chorus. So I studied.</p>

<p>You are welcome to skip all of this, but I know there are a few people out there like me who <em>just need to know!</em></p>

<p>Here's a description of the songs, mostly from the Birds of North America:</p>

<p>1) dry, sharp, 2-syllabled <em>SE-pit</em> delivered briskly (reminiscent of <em>cheBEK</em> of least flycatcher, but with accent on first syllable)</p>

<p>2) low-pitched, burry <em>tsurrt</em>, that ends with tiny, high tonal note</p>

<p>3) <em>SE-luurt</em>. A rougher version of <em>SE-pit</em>, more drawn out, also 2-syllabled, but ending with low, burry <em>luurt</em>
This Hammond's flycatcher is in dawn song, competing with another male in the background. I hear his three expected songs, this sequence beginning with <em>SE-pit, tsurrt, SE-lurrt, SE-pit, tsurrt, SE-pit, SE-lurrt, tsurrt, SE-pit</em>, all during the first ten seconds.</p>

<p>It's difficult to see a pattern when the mnemonics are used, so let me substitute A, B, C for <em>SE-pit, tsurrt</em>, and <em>SE-lurrt</em> and then see what the sequence looks like for the first minute: A B C A B A C B A B A C A B A B A C A B A C A B A C A A B A B A C A B C B A A B C A A B C A B A B A C.</p>

<p>Then I prepare a contingency table, showing which songs follow which. What is most clear is that he never sings the same song back-to-back. The A-B and B-A sequences are most common, such 14 and 12 times, respectively, indicating that his favored sequences are between the two songs <em>SE-pit</em> and <em>tsurrt</em>. The <em>SE-pit _ (A) songs are most common, the _SE-lurrt</em> (C) least common.</p>

<p>SONG    A   B   C</p>

<p>A   0   14  7</p>

<p>B   12  0   4</p>

<p>C   8   2   0</p>

<p>Sums    20  16  11</p>

<p>I'd need to study this same bird on another morning, or other birds as well, to see how performances differed before I'd be completely satisfied. But this is a good start to understanding the Hammond's. </p>
