<p>Just a few yards overhead, a brown thrasher runs through five minutes of his good stuff. As song after song drops down to my ears, each one different from the others, I can well imagine that he has a few thousand different songs that he can sing.</p>

<p>Knowing that some brown thrashers are good imitators, I listen carefully, trying to pick out what he might have pilfered from other species, and come up with a list of which I'm fairly confident: </p>

<p>0:33, song sparrow</p>

<p>0:44, Carolina chickadee song</p>

<p>0:52, American goldfinch</p>

<p>1:25, Carolina chickadee call</p>

<p>2:01, female red-winged blackbird</p>

<p>2:22, Carolina wren</p>

<p>2:25, northern flicker <em>wik-wik-wik</em> song</p>

<p>2:33, northern cardinal single song syllable</p>

<p>2:42, Carolina chickadee song, <em>again</em></p>

<p>3:31, tree swallow?</p>

<p>4:52, American goldfinch? </p>

<p>Had he the inclination to sing here for a few hours, I'd have sat with him, listening forever. I heard that hi-lo-hi Carolina chickadee song twice, and I'd love to know how often he repeats it. And that call of a female red-winged blackbird was so distinctive--I'd be sure to recognize that again. </p>

<p>Yes, I'd sit here, comfortably, timing how long it takes him to return to the most recognizable songs, perhaps counting off the number of other songs that intervene, so that I'd have a better feeling for how soon he returns to particular sounds and, after some simple calculations, roughly how many different songs he's singing during a performance like this. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Mostly crowing roosters in a neighbor's yard; more faintly, eastern towhee, American crow, tufted titmouse, Carolina wren.</p>
