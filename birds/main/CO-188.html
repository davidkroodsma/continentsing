<p>A Cassin's sparrow singing at a leisurely pace, 17 songs over five minutes, a song every 15 to 20 seconds. His song repertoire size of three is played out in the following sequence, minute by minute: </p>

<p>A B B C </p>

<p>B B A</p>

<p>A B B </p>

<p>B B A </p>

<p>A C B </p>

<p>B . . .</p>

<p>In this brief selection he clearly favors song B, and song C is least used.</p>

<p>But that's only part of what he's up to. With every other song or so, he launches into the air, singing on the wing, sky-dancing around his territory. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Western meadowlark, ring-necked pheasant, brown-headed cowbird, another Cassin's sparrow, mourning dove, grasshopper sparrow, horned lark. </p>
