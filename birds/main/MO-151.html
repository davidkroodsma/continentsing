<p>A Bell's vireo at dawn. In the darkness, I stand beside the bush in which he sings, marveling at how close to the source I am. As the books say, he seems to ask a question and then answer it, each song with a rising note on the end followed by a song with a falling note. </p>

<p>Curious, I import his songs into my favorite sonagram program and follow along, trying to understand his method. Minute by minute I chart the songs:</p>

<p><strong>A B C A D C A C A</strong> E F E <strong>C</strong> F E G F E F E G </p>

<p>F E G F E G F E G F E F E F E G F E G F </p>

<p>E G E F E G F E G F E G F E G F E G <strong>D</strong> </p>

<p>F E G <strong>D H B H B H B H B H B H B H B H C B H</strong> </p>

<p><strong>B H B A C A B H C A B C A C A</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm fascinated by what I see. During these five minutes, he uses eight different songs, which I've lettered A-H. He never repeats himself immediately, but often alternates a pair of songs, such as C A C A. And eventually, after leaving song A behind midway through the first minute, he returns to it in the fifth, suggesting that these five minutes have effectively captured his entire song repertoire. </p>

<p>Seeing how songs A, B, C, D, and H (bold) and songs E, F, and G (nonbold) tend to cluster together suggests that he, like some other vireos, also sings in packages.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Yellow-breasted chat, dickcissel, northern bobwhite; and the sound of a prairie train, with nice whistles and a little distant rumble.</p>
