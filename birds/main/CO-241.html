<p>Twenty-four songs over four minutes, a song every ten seconds, <em>quick, THREE BEERS!</em> I am not sure why the heart warms when I hear this song, but I think it's because I first heard it on a field trip to northern Michigan way back in 1968 when I was taking my two ornithology courses from Olin Sewall Pettingill Jr. The song was unmistakable then, as it is now, the mnemonic unforgettable: <em>quick, THREE BEERS!</em>. Other mnemonics, such as <em>hip, THREE CHEERS!</em>, don't quite measure up.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>House wren, western tanager, horned lark.</p>
