<p>From the border of Kansas and Colorado west to the Pacific, it is the Bullocks oriole that replaces the Baltimore. </p>

<p>Here is a Bullock's oriole, unmistakable by his typical chatter, but his songs seem so tentative and playful, almost as if hes a young bird. But when he sings, each song is repeated in the precise kind of fashion expected from an adult. So I conclude that hes an adult, but that I just need to get to know Bullock's orioles better so I can understand better what Im hearing. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Willow flycatcher (western variety), yellow warbler (still chipping between songs during dawn singing), song sparrow, red-winged blackbird, American coot (2:00-2:05), pied-billed grebe (2:10). </p>
