<p>It's early, and dark. Nearby a yellow-breasted chat sings, as he probably has throughout much of the night. And here's the willow flycatcher singing as well, before any other day birds have joined the dawn chorus. </p>

<p>This willow flycatcher has the standard three songs expected of him: the <em>FITZ-bew</em>, the <em>FIZZ-bew</em>, and the <em>creet</em>.  Most distinctive is the <em>creet</em>, a sharp, rising, quarter-second note (0:07). The <em>FITZ-bew</em> (the first song in this recording, heard at 0:05) begins with a sharp tonal note, whereas the first note of the <em>FIZZ-bew</em> is raspy (third song, at 0:08). Although the mnemonic for the ending of both of these songs is "<em>bew</em>," that for the <em>FIZZ-bew</em> is markedly higher-pitched and more intense.</p>

<p>With a backdrop of bullfrogs and chat, for the first 30 seconds listen to the songs of this bird play out: </p>

<p><em>FITZ-bew</em>, <em>creet</em>, <em>FIZZ-bew</em>, <em>creet</em>, <em>FITZ-bew</em>, <em>creet</em>, <em>FITZ-bew</em>, <em>creet</em>, <em>FIZZ-bew</em>. </p>

<p>Follow along for another ten minutes and you begin to understand what the night singing of a willow flycatcher is all about. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Frogs, mostly bullfrog, some green frogs, and yellow-breasted chat dominate the background. Barn swallows call and sing on the wing (e.g., 1:55). There's a single song sparrow song, as he stirs in the dark. Water cascades constantly over the spillway here at Homestead Lake. It's still an hour and a quarter until sunrise!</p>
