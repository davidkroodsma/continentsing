<p>With a western kingbird in dawn song off to the right (listen with stereo headphones), an eastern kingbird joins in. He sputters and stutters, <em>t't'tzeer,t't'tzeer,t'tzeetzeeTZEET, t't'tzeer,t't'tzeer, t'tzeetzeeTZEET</em>, repeatedly, over and over.</p>

<p>With the two kingbirds side by side, their songs make a nice comparison. Even though the males of each species are about the same weight (about 40 grams), the eastern song is much higher than that of the western.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Western kingbird, ring-necked pheasant, great horned owl (0:32), pied-billed grebe.</p>
