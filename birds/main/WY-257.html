<p>The Ear Spring, a four by six foot hot spring in the Upper Geyser Basin at Yellowstone. It's shaped much like an ear, hence its name; it boils and bubbles steadily, 24/7/365, endlessly, but at times surges (e.g., listen about 2:55 for the activity to pick up). </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Maybe a killdeer if you listen closely.</p>
