<p>Often throughout the day, one hears these treetop songs, the bird itself rarely seen. In daytime singing, this western wood-pewee offers 21 <em>bzeeyeer</em> songs over three minutes, seven songs per minute. That's about 1/6th of his dawn pace, and now he sings only his <em>bzeeyeer</em> song--how  differently he sings now compared to his grand performance before sunrise.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Cedar waxwing (loud "begging" beginning at 0:43), western tanager, house wren, spotted towhee (nice songs, calls), American robin, American goldfinch (e.g., 2:54). </p>
