<p>A western kingbird in dawn song. In the predawn darkness I can walk up to him and listen closely, hearing his feet shuffle on the perch, hearing every little <em>kip</em> and <em>ki-PEP</em> and <em>PEEP</em> that he makes.</p>

<p>I love the energy in his dawn singing, <em>kip kip kip kip kip kip ki-PIP ki-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP</em>.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Occasional dive sound of common nighthawk (0:05, 0:19, 0:44), ring-necked pheasant. </p>
