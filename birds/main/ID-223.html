<p>A rock wren singing from basalt rubble on a hilltop in sagebrush country. He accommodates my limited senses, alternating just two songs at first, A B A B A B A, then introduces another type, C B C B C B D C B D C . . . It's typical rock wren--no successive songs are the same, and he just rolls through his song repertoire.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Western meadowlark, American crow, brown-headed cowbird, yellow warbler</p>
