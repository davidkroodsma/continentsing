<p>A spotted towhee awakes, calling <em>zhree zhree</em> at first before singing 47 songs over nearly four minutes, at a clip of about 12 songs/minute. He uses three different songs and alternates songs A and B some, but then repeats song C 11 times during the fourth minute. He is just awaking, and will likely build to a more intense dawn performance when two or even three different songs are consistently alternated.  </p>

<p>The Swainson's thrushes are also awaking. They call at first, the nearer male using a rising, tonal sreee, but he switches to another call at 0:52 to match his neighbors call (best heard 1:00-1:03). At 1:07 the foreground male switches to yet another call, a brief tonal note followed by a rapid trill, and the background male can be heard giving the same call by 1:40. They clearly communicate in some fashion by matching each others calls at dawn, before they begin singing (first song heard at 2:28).</p>
