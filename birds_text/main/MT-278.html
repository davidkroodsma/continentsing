<p>A bobolink sings from the open fields near the entrance to the refuge. A quick study of his sonagrams shows that he uses two different songs in this sequence, and theyre readily distinguishable by the first split second of each song. </p>

<p>Listen to the first three songs (A) and at the beginning of each youll hear a trio of nasal, low-high-low twangy notes with the quality for which the bobolink is so well known. The fourth song (B) has a series of three (or four, if you hear the high one) rising notes, and the bobolink twanginess then takes over. </p>

<p>Listen for those clues and youll hear the following sequence in this selection: A A A B B A B A B A B A A B A B A B, though beware that not all songs are complete.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Wilson's snipe winnows and calls, red-winged blackbird, common yellowthroat.</p>
