<p>Dawn singing by a horned lark. He tinkles along for 15 seconds before providing a flourish at 0:16, then offers several series of brief, steady song notes before flourishing again at 0:20, 0:28, and 0:32. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Canada goose, western meadowlark (careful for your ears at 0:02 and 0:13!), savannah sparrow, sora, grasshopper sparrow.</p>
