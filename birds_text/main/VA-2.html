<p>What is it about a wood thrush singing in the rain that so enthralls? For 12 minutes I listened, capturing two minutes in this recording, thrilled by his performance. He sings from fairly low in the understory, with seemingly nothing to disturb him, consistently singing at a clip of 13-14 songs per minute, with 27 songs in this selection. How I wish I could hear far better all that he does after those soft <em>bup bup</em> notes at the beginning, to roll with the melodious tones in the <em>ee-o-lay</em> prelude, to hear how he uses his two voices simultaneously in the more percussive ending.</p>

<p>I listen for a distinctive <em>ee-o-lay</em> phrase just after the <em>bup bup</em> notes, and pick out the third one (at 0:11); Ive heard it before from many other wood thrushes, as it consists of a low note followed by a pair of three, rapidly descending tones. Its there in the third song (3), and then I start counting, 11, 15, 18, 23, 27, all in the first two minutes. If I make a small assumption, that he doesnt especially favor or disfavor this particular <em>ee-o-lay</em>, I can divide 27 by 5 and calculate that he has about five different <em>ee-o-lay</em> phrases in his repertoire.</p>

<p>I explore further, listening and viewing the sonagrams in Raven-lite, giving letter labels to all of the <em>ee-o-lay</em> phrases, giving number labels to the ending trills, and within minutes I have a better feeling for what hes up to. In half-minute blocks of time, heres what he does during these two minutes:</p>

<p>A1 B2 C3 A4 D2 B5 E6</p>

<p>D3 A7 B1 C8 E6 D3</p>

<p>A4 C8 B5 A1 C3 B2 A4</p>

<p>B1 A7 C8 E6 A4 B2 C3</p>

<p>Yes, he does have five different <em>ee-o-lay</em> phrases, lettered A, B, C, D, and E. Its satisfying that my casual listening and detailed analyses produce the same results. And I number eight different ending trills, 1-8. I can readily see how he creates the variety in his singing, too. Look at the A phrases and see how theyre coupled with ending phrase 1, 4, or 7, but no others: A1, A4, A7, A4, A1, A4, A7, A4. B occurs with 1, 2, 5; C with 3 and 8; and so on.</p>

<p>How satisfying to capture a small glimpse of what is stored in this wood thrushs mind and understand how he packages one of the finest performances any bird can put together.</p>
