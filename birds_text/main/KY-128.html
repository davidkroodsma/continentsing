<p>A great crested flycatcher in dawn song.</p>

<p>Back-to-back <em>wheeee-up</em> songs are always different, and it sounds like he mostly alternates a low frequency, low-intensity <em>wheeee-up</em> with a high frequency, high-intensity, more raspy <em>wheeee-up</em>.  </p>

<p>With all of the other birds here in full dawn mode, that low, soft buzzy note interspersed among the louder <em>wheeee-up</em> calls is often difficult to hear. Train your ears on 0:12 for the first truly audible low note, again at 0:22; he doesnt always give it after every two <em>wheeee-up</em>s, and here its tough to distinguish the flycatchers low note from the occasional low notes of a chat in the background.</p>

<p>He embellishes the dawn message a little at 1:24, a hint of the rich, raucous repertoire to follow during the daytime. Immediately after that, hear how he gives two of the high-intensity, high-frequency, raspy <em>wheeee-up</em>s back to back.</p>
