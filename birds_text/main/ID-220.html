<p>Seven daytime songs from a second Brewer's sparrow (see also ID-219). As is typical, the song is two-parted, with the first phrase buzzy, the second part of more slowly repeated syllables. For this male, the first part is lower than the second, something like <em>zirrrrrrrrrrrrrr zee zee zee zee zee zee zee</em>. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Song sparrow, western meadowlark (calls and songs), rock wren, mosquito, brown-headed cowbird. </p>
