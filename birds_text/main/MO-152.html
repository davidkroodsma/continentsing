<p>Two yellow-breasted chats, one in the foreground, one more distant. Its intriguing that each male stays on his unique package of songs throughout this three minutes and 20 seconds, each one working over his own particular subset of songs that he has mastered. For the background chat, the very first sound in this selection is the same as his songs at 2:45 and 3:06. For the foreground chat, listen to the single harsh <em>zwack</em> at 0:09 and hear it again in a series at 0:17, as singles at 0:35, 0:43, 1:01, and repeatedly all the way through to the triple at 2:53.</p>

<p>I would bet that some gamesmanship is involved in who switches first to a new series of sounds, and when. Though they dont match each others songs, given that each may have a unique repertoire, they can still interact in other ways, by which particular songs they choose to sing at the same time, whether they overlap each others efforts, when they switch to a new series of songs. Some day Ill park myself between two chats and listen through the night and into the dawn to try to understand them better. </p>
