<p>Purple martins fly high overhead here at Ferne Clyffe State Park. I aim the parabola skyward, just trying to hold it steady and collect sounds from whoever is singing up there. How many males I cannot know, but presumably these are older birds singing so as to attract migrant first-year birds to the local nesting colony. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A dog. Distant highway noise. Insects. No other birds are stirring so early.</p>
