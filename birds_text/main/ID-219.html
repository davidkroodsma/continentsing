<p>Seven daytime songs of a Brewer's Sparrow, each a second-long buzzy phrase followed by a second and a half series of repeated syllables. Perhaps you hear it as something like <em>zrreeeeeeeee zir zir zir zir zir zir zir</em>.</p>

<p>One thinks of the Brewer's Sparrow as inhabiting arid sagebrush, but as heard in this recording, this male has set up residence next to a delightful stream that drains the mountainside here.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Spotted towhee, lazuli bunting.</p>
