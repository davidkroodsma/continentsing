<p>Half an hour after sunrise, a western tanager in a highly repetitious mood. The first song contains five phrases, a b c d e; the remaining eight songs are all the same, consisting only of the phrases a b c d, without the e on the end. Thats seems rather repetitious for a tanager, as quite often only the first two or so phrases are the same, the rest of the song varying in unpredictable ways. </p>

<p>How rapidly does he deliver his phrases? An average of 2.3 phrases/second, much faster than a dawn singer (e.g., OR-246). </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Yellow warbler, American robin, pine siskin (nice song about 0:41), chipping sparrow, another western tanager. </p>
