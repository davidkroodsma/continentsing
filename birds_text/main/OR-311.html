<p>A western tanager in dawn song. He begins with four slowly delivered song phrases, then his signature call, the <em>pit-er-ick</em>, here sounding perhaps more like a shortened, two-syllable <em>per-dick</em>. </p>

<p>Measuring a few of his song phrases, I calculate that he sings about 1.4 song phrases per second. Thats a typical slow dawn pace for these tanagers.</p>

<p>Other western tanagers in the distance. </p>
