<p>Just 10 or so yards away, a chestnut-sided warbler is in dawn song, chipping between songs, delivering the same rambling unaccented ending song throughout. Hes a puzzle, because he has a whole repertoire of these dawn songs stored in his head, and he could choose to sing any one of them, but he specializes in this particular one. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Two brown thrashers (?) <em>churr</em> repeatedly throughout, suggesting I may be near their nest or young. Dogs, a cow, crowing rooster, together with mourning dove, eastern towhee, American crow.</p>
