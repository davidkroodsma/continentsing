<p>A mystery bird when first encountered--I didnt know who he was, but eventually identified him days later as a Lincoln's sparrow. Feel the rhythm of the songs and youll hear that all ten songs here are the same. </p>

<p>The song rolls through three burry notes, drops down for three notes, rises to three higher notes, and finally rises still higher for the concluding seven notes, ending on a single low note (plus or minus one note in each part of the song). </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>American robin, MacGillivray's warbler (e.g., loud at 0:22), sandhill cranes bugling (1:09), sapsucker drums (1:18), house wren. It was probably a red-naped sapsucker, given the aspen grove here (Williamsons sapsucker would be expected in more coniferous habitat).</p>
