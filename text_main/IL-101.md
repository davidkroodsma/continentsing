Male and female blackbirds go about their business, singing and calling. 

The male sings only three times in this selection, in the sequence A (at 0:04), B and B (at 1:05 and 1:46), the A song highly buzzy, the two B songs strongly pulsating. 

Females call intensely, especially after the maleâ€™s song; listen to the two females who call during and just after the first song, for example, and one female calls intensely after the last song, at 1:47.

And he _calls_ as well, using a variety throughout. From 0:30 to 0:40, for example, you can hear four different calls given by the same male, all calls that are part of the local dialect here along the Mississippi River.
