Three northern flickers joust in the dead snags at the Quivira refuge. One in the background initially sings the _wik-wik-wik_ song, overlapped by loud _flicka-flicka-flicka_ calls of a second bird. Ten seconds later half-hearted _flicka-flicka_ calls are followed by a drum, lasting a second and a half, at the rate of about 22 raps per second. 

I listen well beyond this half minute: As birds in the background carry on, especially a mourning dove, American robin, and a great crested flycatcher, these three flickers fly about the tree, occasionally singing, calling, drumming, and chasing each other.
