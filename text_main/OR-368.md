He’s known for having a song full of Z’s, this black-throated gray warbler. I hear this male’s version as _buzZEE buzZEE buzZEE buzZEE ZEE_, with four identical _buzZEE_ song phrases followed by a higher-pitched _ZEE._ Hear how the song builds, too, the first _buzZEE_ being rather soft, the last often the loudest, before the intense _ZEE_ on the end. Eight songs in a minute and 20 seconds, at the daytime rate of six songs per minute.
