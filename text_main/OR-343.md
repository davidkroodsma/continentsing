It’s a hawk . . . no, wait, it’s a Steller's jay mimicking the asthmatic kee-eeee-arrr scream of a red-tailed hawk! The sound isn’t quite asthmatic enough—it’s a little too pure and tonal for a red-tail, and not drawn out enough either. Also, a red-tail wouldn’t call this frequently. As this bird emerged from the dense vegetation, its identity was clear, and especially when it proclaimed _shook shook shook_ while flying away.

Lazuli bunting, orange-crowned warbler, western wood-pewee, another songbird at 0:11 that I don’t quite recognize (jumbled song—warbling vireo?)
