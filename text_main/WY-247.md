A western tanager, over and over he calls, _pit-er-ick_, a dry, quarter-second, rising rattle; finally, after two and a half minutes, he offers three song phrases. We think these tanagers call like this when they’re perturbed in some way, though what it is that he’s fussing about is unclear.

_Pit-er-ick_. One finds a mnemonic and then tends to be done with it. Yes, he’s calling, _pit-er-ick_. But step beyond that and listen to how he enunciates this simple call time after time. Maybe the first call in this selection is _pit-er-ick_, but the second call is more like _pit-er-eek_, the last syllable higher and less harsh. The third call also ends with a tonal note, but it is lower than that of the second call. 

There’s a lot going on in these simple calls, and I wish I knew what was on the mind of this tanager as he varied his calls in this way. Perhaps nothing was on his mind, I realize is one possibility, but when I see variation like this, I tend to think the bird knows what he is doing and has a reason for it all.
