In 30 seconds, one knows what this pewee is capable of doing, but I listened to its entire dawn chorus. Here are the 13 minutes that I recorded. 

From beside our tent in Alder, Montana, at a clip of about 40 songs/minute, this bird delivers minute after minute throughout the dawn chorus. He typically alternates his two songs, _tswee-tee-teet_ (A) and _bzeeyeer_ (B), but occasionally also throws in a third “song,” a tonal tsweeeeeer (C, such as at 0:18, 1:20, 1:47, 2:17, 2:55,3:34, 3:54, 4:20, 4:36, and more). I’d love to know more about that third sound.

Here’s what he does during the first minute alone, in 30 second blocks:

B A A B A B A B A B A C B A B A B A B A

B A B A A B A B A B A A B A B A B A B A A B A

I find it curious that his longest pause, of three seconds, is when a car passes on the road. He quickly resumes his torrid pace, however.
