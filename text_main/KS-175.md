A western kingbird in dawn song. From his perch he sputters and bickers a nearly continuous _kip kip kip ki-PIP_, single _kip_ notes followed by an occasional double _ki-PIP_, with a strong emphasis on the _PIP_, and every few seconds he delivers a flourish of longer and louder notes, _ki-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP_, the emphasis strong at first and then trailing off. He had been singing here for perhaps 15 minutes before I caught up with him, and he sings for only two more minutes before flying off at 2:18 to sing elsewhere.
