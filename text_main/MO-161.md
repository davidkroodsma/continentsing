Calls of an eastern meadowlark. _Dzeet, dzeet, dzeet, dzeet, dzeet-chatter_—in the first 12 seconds he tells what he’s all about in this selection. No songs, just calling from a perch about 50 yards away. Sometimes it’s just the isolated _dzeet_, sometimes the _dzeet_ with the typical eastern meadowlark chatter. Perhaps he’s disturbed that I’m walking into his territory? Maybe. At 2:44, he relents and flies off, then calls from a greater distance at 2:52.
