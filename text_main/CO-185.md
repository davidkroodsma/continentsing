There, beside the road, a rock wren, and I catch just a few songs, but it is the sign of good things to come. Knowing how he delivers his songs, I listen intently, and catch him in the act. It’s A B C A B here, and then he’s done. 

Just five songs, and three different ones out of the hundred or so he can sing, delivered in a typical rock wren pattern.
#####Background
A bit of wind, distant birds.
