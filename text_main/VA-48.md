Like a metronome, this ovenbird delivers his crescendo song, each song building in intensity through to the final phase. It’s a “_teacher_” song all right, but the “_te_” is so brief and relatively soft that the song is dominated by the emphatic, down-slurred _CHER_, sounding like a series of _t-CHER_ phrases.
#####Background
A pileated woodpecker drums in the distance initially, with distant black-throated blue warbler, hermit thrush, scarlet tanager, chestnut-sided warbler.
