Twenty-three songs from a mountain chickadee, part of a longer 28-minute session during which he sang this same song throughout. 

_Fa-beeee-beeee-beeee_? Does that mnemonic come close? Four whistles all on the same frequency, with the first just 1/20th of a second, the other three about 1/3rd of a second. He uses this song throughout the 28 minutes, as if he had no other, and perhaps he doesnâ€™t. This song with the three loud whistles is the one we hear throughout the Rockies of Colorado.
#####Background
Ruby-crowned kinglet, hairy woodpecker, another mountain chickadee (_tsick-a-dee-dee-dee_), hermit thrush.
