A mountain white-crowned sparrow sings the local dialect. He begins with a low, half-second whistled note, but he wavers twice, giving the note a three-part effect; next is a third of a second rising, buzzy note; third is a complex phrase consisting of three different notes; and last is a trill of simple, three to five falling notes, all together a nice four-part song. 

His is a familiar tune here, with other white-crowned sparrows singing what sound like identical songs, all of them having learned the local song dialect.
