Three songs of a MacGillivray's warbler, two-parted, _cheer cheer cheer cheer cheer choor choor_, the last two phrases lower. I donâ€™t hear the two-syllable _cheery choory_ notes heard from many of these warblers.

And how nice to hear the special intelligence of a Clark's nutcracker sounding off in the background throughout this half-minute selection. 
#####Background
