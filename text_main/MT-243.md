A Swainson's thrush sings from high atop a spruce tree overlooking Chief Joseph Pass. As with any good singing thrush, I canâ€™t help exploring his song repertoire, and Raven soon shows me that he has three different songs, singing them consistently in a repeating A B C sequence throughout this selection. 
#####Background
Mountain chickadee, plus wind in the trees and snow-melt trickling down the roadside stream.
