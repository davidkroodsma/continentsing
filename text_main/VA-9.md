Here is a pace typical of dawn singing for an eastern towhee, with 12 songs in this minute. He is just awaking, and no doubt will build to a more intense dawn chorus in which he will consistently alternate different songs. 

Now, 45 minutes before sunrise, he sings in the following sequence: A A A B A B B B B B B B. The A song is a typical _drink-your-teeeee_, but the B song is more of a simplified _your-teeeee_, without the first introductory note. 

#####Background
American robin, indigo bunting, another eastern towhee.
