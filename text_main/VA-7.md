A fish crow, not with the hoarse _caw caw_ of the American crow, but with its smaller, nasal _ca-ha, ca-ha_, almost as if he’s laughing at us. Fifteen times he calls, through 1:06, but then at 1:07 he flies from the perch above the visitors’ center at the Yorktown National Battlefield, perhaps to join his friend who called just before off to the left, at 1:06. 

#####Background
A northern mockingbird predominates; a few songs from a chipping sparrow, distant calls of an American crow, and a second fish crow near the end. Noisy Yorktown in the distance.
