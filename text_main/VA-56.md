Late morning, insects seem to rule the soundscape. 

But there’s an alder flycatcher among them! Throughout he gives his standard _fee-BEE-o_ song, or _frree-BREER-a_, depending on your favorite mnemonic. But there’s more to him, as interspersed among his songs are _tu-weet_ calls (e.g., 0:02, 0:09) that fall and then rise. 

Enjoy the flies, bees, whatever insects they all are!

#####Background
Flies abound. A house wren (e.g., 0:06), song sparrow (0:10), chestnut-sided warbler (1:33), Canada warbler (1:13).
