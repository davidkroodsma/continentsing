Dawn singing by a horned lark. He tinkles along for 15 seconds before providing a flourish at 0:16, then offers several series of brief, steady song notes before flourishing again at 0:20, 0:28, and 0:32. 

Each of the four flourishes is different from the others (as seen in sonagrams), four of the ten or so that he has memorized and uses throughout his dawn performance. 
#####Background
Canada goose, western meadowlark (careful for your ears at 0:02 and 0:13!), savannah sparrow, sora, grasshopper sparrow.
