An eastern phoebe alternates the only two songs that he knows, his _FEE-b-bre-be_ with the stuttered ending (0:03, 0:07, etc.) and his _FEE-bee_ with the raspy ending (0:05, 0:10, etc). Only once does he break rhythm, at 1:05, when he sings two _FEE-bee_ songs back-to-back. 

And he has rhythm. See MO-150 for how to listen more closely to his rhythm.
