Just 22 songs over a minute and a half gives one a taste of western marsh wrens. The variety of songs seems endless, the qualities mesmerizing, from slow buzzes to fast rattles, single and double songs, sharp tonal sounds to harsh broad-band sounds. 

It’s not beneath him to repeat himself in this brief sequence, however, and if you listen carefully to the first song you’ll hear it again in the sixth song (but don’t be duped by the song at 0:43—it’s subtly different).
