This stream-side song sparrow offers 11 songs, the first three of one kind, the last six of another. Listen for the sharp tonal notes that introduce the first three songs, and how different they are from the buzzy notes of the fourth song. I like how the tempo of those introductory notes accelerates, a trait typical of song sparrows everywhere.
