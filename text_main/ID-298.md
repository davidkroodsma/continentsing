Spotted towhees, lots of them, at least five audible in this recording. The foreground bird sings clearly, repeating one of his songs eight times before switching to a new one (at 0:52), which he then offers seven times. The near bird in the background alternates two songs throughout. 
#####Background
An American robin singing constantly.
