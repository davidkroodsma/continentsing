Beating sunrise by about ten minutes, he begins with a flourish (0:03), with rising sputtering notes; he then tinkles a bit until the next flourish at 0:10. It’s not the vigorous singing of the dawn chorus, but for this late in the day, just a few minutes before sunrise, it’ll do just fine, I can almost hear him say. His singing surges and fades with his will to sing, it seems, ending on a bit of a whimpered flourish (1:08).
