A Bell's vireo at dawn. In the darkness, I stand beside the bush in which he sings, marveling at how close to the source I am. As the books say, he seems to ask a question and then answer it, each song with a rising note on the end followed by a song with a falling note. 

Curious, I import his songs into my favorite sonagram program and follow along, trying to understand his method. Minute by minute I chart the songs:

A B C A D C A C A E F E C F E G F E F E G 

F E G F E G F E G F E F E F E G F E G F 

E G E F E G F E G F E G F E G F E G D 

F E G D H B H B H B H B H B H B H B H C B H 

B H B A C A B H C A B C A C A.

I’m fascinated by what I see. During these five minutes, he uses eight different songs, which I’ve lettered A-H. He never repeats himself immediately, but often alternates a pair of songs, such as C A C A. And eventually, after leaving song A behind midway through the first minute, he returns to it in the fifth, suggesting that these five minutes have effectively captured his entire song repertoire.

Yellow-breasted chat, dickcissel, northern bobwhite; and the sound of a prairie train, with nice whistles and a little distant rumble.
