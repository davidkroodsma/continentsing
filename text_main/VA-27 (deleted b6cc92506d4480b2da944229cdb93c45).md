How nice to listen in on a great crested flycatcher at dawn. 
He sings from just overhead, but in such a curious fashion: He alternates one or two low, nearly inaudible buzzy _twrp_ notes with one or two much louder _wheeee-up_ notes. To my ears, he seems to use two different kinds of _wheeee-up_ notes, often alternating them; one is more drawn out with the second syllable a low tonal note (at 0:02, for example), the other a little briefer with the second syllable a higher raspy note (0:04).
 
Here’s an interesting exercise. Try listening to  the following recording in which I’ve deleted all of the low _twrp_ notes and all of the silent intervals between the _wheeee-up_ notes. Now you hear all of the _wheeee-up_ notes in rapid succession and can more clearly hear what seem to be these two different _wheeee-up_ notes.

Then listen to the actual sequence from the bird once more and try to piece together in your head what he’s doing in his head. You’ll never listen to a great crested flycatcher in the same way again.
