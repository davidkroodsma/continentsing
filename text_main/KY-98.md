A remarkable mimic, taking the calls of other birds and incorporating those calls into his songs.

The contents of this recording:

1) Frist 7 songs, from 0:00 to 0:34. These songs begin with four or five sharp whit-whit calls pilfered from a wood thrush. 

2) Next 8 songs, 0:34 to 1:17. The second song type is easily distinguished from the others, but the mimicry in it is not so obvious to me.

3)  Last 9 songs, 1:17 to end. The mimicry here is special. The second note of this third song type is a prominent _wheeee-up_ call of a great crested flycatcher; a split second later are what sounds like two _dee_ calls from the _chick-a-dee-dee_ of a Carolina chickadee (recognizable only when I isolated that part of the song and played those two notes by themselves); and toward the end are two sharp _whit-whit_ notes of the wood thrush.

He has perhaps six to nine other songs he could sing as well, each one consisting largely of mimicry of other species, it seems.
