Pied-billed grebes, on a pond surrounded by marsh, hence the rich soundscape of wetland birds here. At least three pairs are calling on this pond. Just listen to the extended series of _kuk kuk kuk_ notes at the beginning of a song, how they transition into a series of _kaow kaow kaow_ notes, the entire song lasting perhaps 15 seconds. I’m not sure whether two or three birds are involved in the sequence from 0:05 to 0:35. 

As two pairs approach each other, there’s a rush and splashing (2:22), and near the end of this selection (3:07) two birds greet each other, most likely male and female, with a rapid series of _ek-ek-ek_ calls, followed by _kaow kaow_ calls.
