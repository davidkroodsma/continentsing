An American wigeon swims upstream, calling six times, a three-parted, airy whistle, _wee WHEE whew_, the first _wee_ note barely audible over the river noise. He’s accompanied by the harsh quacks of what may be a female wigeon. Just before the male’s last _wee WHEE whew_, a Clark's nutcracker sounds off (0:23), and two nutcrackers are heard again after 0:45. The quacking duck occurs again at 0:56-1:11.
#####Background
Northern waterthrush, American Robin, yellow warbler, ruby-crowned kinglet, Clark's nutcracker, western wood-pewee, and the hissy flow of water in the North Fork of the Big Hole River.
