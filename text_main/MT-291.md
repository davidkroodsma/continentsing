A trio of red-naped sapsuckers, two males and a female, the males perhaps contesting for the female, maybe for the territory, or for both. They fly about, but who drums and who calls I cannot keep track of. At least two birds drum, though, perhaps best heard between 4:40 and 4:50, when two sapsuckers drum on surfaces with highly different resonance. The most intense calling is last, just after five minutes.
