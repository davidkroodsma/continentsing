_BOB-WHITE!_ The male perches somewhere out in the low bushes beside a prairie stream, calling his name repeatedly. _BOB-WHITE!_ Every 15 to 20 seconds, _BOB-WHITE!_ What he does between calling I can only guess, because heâ€™s well out of sight. _BOB -WHITE!_ What a nice diversion listening to the Bell's vireo, the common yellowthroat, the American goldfinch, the trickling stream, until our attention is again riveted on the _BOB-WHITE!_
#####Background
I stand out on the prairie, aiming the parabolic microphone into a riparian belt beside a stream. It is the northern bobwhite that most interests me, but listen for all of the other birds that he lives with: Bell's vireo, common yellowthroat, eastern towhee, American goldfinch, dickcissel, red-winged blackbird, yellow-breasted chat, indigo bunting, willow flycatcher, brown thrasher, American crow.
