<p><em>Tseee tseee tseee tsee tsee tse tse tew tew tew tew tew tew te te te tee-LETT tee-LETT tee-LETT tee-LETT tee-LETT</em>. All 17 of them! </p>

<p>These are special songs beginning high and thin in a squeaky voice, squeezing out two or so seconds of <em>tseee</em> notes that gradually shorten, then plummeting to the lower <em>tew tew te te</em> notes, which also shorten and drop in frequency, before ending in the galloping, emphatic _tee-LETT tee-LETT _series. It is a masterpiece! </p>

<p>That broad-tailed hummingbird in the background? 44 beats of his wings/second, matching some earlier calculations. Nice.</p>
