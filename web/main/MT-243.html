<p>A Swainson's thrush sings from high atop a spruce tree overlooking Chief Joseph Pass. As with any good singing thrush, I cant help exploring his song repertoire, and Raven soon shows me that he has three different songs, singing them consistently in a repeating A B C sequence throughout this selection. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Mountain chickadee, plus wind in the trees and snow-melt trickling down the roadside stream.</p>
