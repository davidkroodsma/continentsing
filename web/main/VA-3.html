<p>During relaxed singing, a Carolina chickadee sings many examples of one song before switching to another, but this excited male runs quickly through his repertoire, sometimes even alternating different songs (e.g., A B A B A), adding a few aggressive gargle calls as well.</p>

<p>What a nice variety of songs he delivers, with whistled notes varying beautifully in both pitch and duration. The first song is a striking five-note affair (A), and at 0:27 he introduces song B, at 1:31 song C. Using these letters and g for the aggressive gargle notes, the first two minutes of this selection can be coded as follows:</p>

<p>A A A g g A B B B g B B A</p>

<p>B A B A A g g C C C C C B</p>

<p>It gets a little complicated with the C songs, because in his excitement he adds one or two notes from song A to the end of his C song (Ive coded those songs as C).</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Wood thrush, Carolina wren, yellow-throated warbler, eastern towhee, tufted titmouse, ovenbird.</p>
