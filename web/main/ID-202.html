<p>(I couldnt resist providing the entire six and a half minutes, just a brief selection from what this flycatcher does every dawn.)</p>

<p>A cordilleran flycatcher, no doubt--cant be the sound-alike Pacific-slope flycatcher, as Im well east of their range along the Pacific. I hear the three different songs, the first four songs being <em>ka-SLWEEP, ka-SLWEEP, pa-TIK, seeet</em>. The <em>ka-SLWEEP</em> is sharply tonal and rising; the _pa-TIK _is an abrupt, harsh double note; the _seeet _a single high tonal note. Very distinctive, I try to convince myself, and that Id know this bird anywhere, unless Im anywhere near the Pacific, of course, where the sound-alike, look-alike, maybe-even-the-same-species Pacific-slope flycatcher lives. </p>

<p>But theres a small complication, a fourth type of vocalization given at 2:02, and then it occurs sporadically after that (2:28, 2:57, 3:34, 3:43, 3:54, 3:59, 4:16, 5:03, 5:23, 6:25). I wonder what to make of that? This fourth sound is much like the <em>ka-SLWEEP</em>, tonal and rising, but its a single note, not distinctly double--more like_ suWEET_. Perhaps this is the position note that the birds use throughout the day, and it creeps into the singing here when the bird is less motivated to sing. I need to spend more time among these flycatchers, to get to know them better.</p>
