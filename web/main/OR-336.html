<p>I prowl the campground before sunrise, stopping beside this junco. He sings at a rapid clip during the dawn chorus, even this late in the year, delivering 18 songs each minute, all 41 songs here of the same kind. </p>

<p>For eight minutes and 40 seconds I stood beside him, during which he sang 161 examples of this very song type. Eventually, had I stayed long enough, I am sure that he would have switched to another song in his repertoire, but I had other birds to hear. </p>
