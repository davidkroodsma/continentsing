<p>From a utility wire directly overhead, a dickcissel sings his version of the local dialect: <em>dick dick ciss-ciss-ciss-ciss</em>. For variety, sometimes its only one <em>dick</em>, sometimes only three <em>ciss</em>, but thats about the extent of how much he varies his song. His song is typical of this dialect.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Indigo bunting, American crow, summer tanager, field sparrow.</p>
