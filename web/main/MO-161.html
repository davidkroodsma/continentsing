<p>Calls of an eastern meadowlark. <em>Dzeet, dzeet, dzeet, dzeet, dzeet-chatter</em>--in the first 12 seconds he tells what hes all about in this selection. No songs, just calling from a perch about 50 yards away. Sometimes its just the isolated <em>dzeet</em>, sometimes the <em>dzeet</em> with the typical eastern meadowlark chatter. Perhaps hes disturbed that Im walking into his territory? Maybe. At 2:44, he relents and flies off, then calls from a greater distance at 2:52. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>
