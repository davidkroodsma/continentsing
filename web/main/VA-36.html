<p>Wood thrushes use their sharp <em>whit whit</em> notes upon awaking and going to roost. These two birds are going to roost, and at first they call sharply, <em>whit-whit-whit</em>, back and forth, engaging in some intense pre-roost ritual. Over the nearly five minute interaction here, one bird stays near, but the second retreats off to the right, the interaction fading and surging repeatedly, surging with sharp <em>whit-whit-whit</em> calls, fading with softer <em>pup-pup-pup</em> calls, with an occasional incomplete song thrown in (e.g., 2:44), until all is quiet.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>The quiet of dusk on the Blue Ridge Parkway. A pileated woodpecker calls (2:30). </p>
