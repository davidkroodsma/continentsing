<p>Its too dark to see him, but he cant be more than ten yards from me, an Acadian flycatcher in dawn song; he delivers ten or so <em>peet</em> calls before what is known as the typical <em>PEET-sah</em> song that can be heard throughout the day. Over these two minutes, he runs through ten series of his <em>peet</em> calls, each of which culminates in a single <em>PEET-sah</em>. </p>
