<p>Red crossbills! How Ive been waiting for a close-up of them. I typically hear them flying by, their sharp <em>kip kip</em> calls high overhead, but never in my dreams had I imagined a flock landing on the ground in front of me, then flying up to a tree nearby where theyd call repeatedly before flying off into the distance. </p>

<p>But thats what happens here. At 0:05, they fly from the ground to the top of the nearby tree, where theyve all settled in by 0:16; about ten seconds later they fly off into the distance, as all good crossbills seem eventually to do. </p>

<p>As I scan the sonagrams, I see that all of the calling birds seem to use essentially identical calls. Thats expected, given that these crossbills belong to the goldfinch (Carduelinae) subfamily and the birds in that subfamily learn their calls from each other. </p>

<p>So just which species is this? I check the published catalogue of red crossbill flight calls in the Birds of North America and conclude that this is a type 4 call. I dont know what that means, but some day someone will make sense of the wild variation and possible speciation that seems to have occurred among these birds. </p>
