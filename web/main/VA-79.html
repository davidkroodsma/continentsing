<p>An American redstart in daytime song, repeating the same song over and over with no chipping between songs. I hear it as <em>see-a see-a see-ut</em>, each <em>see-a _slurred downward, the _see-ut</em> ending distinctly lower. In each of the eight songs here, he is on message, each song seemingly identical to all the others, or at least to the best of his ability. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Wood thrush, ovenbird, black-throated-blue warbler, red-eyed vireo.</p>
