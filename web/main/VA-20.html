<p>A second field sparrow, just across Carters Mill Road, offers what sounds like a mournful song to commemorate the occasion of the slaughter here on Malvern Hill. He begins with three pure tonal notes, followed by an abrupt change to a rapid trill of down-slurred whistles. Over and over, with essentially no variation except the number of bounces in the trill, he repeats his mournful dirge.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Rain. Carolina wren, tufted titmouse, American crow, northern cardinal, dogs</p>
