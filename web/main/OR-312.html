<p>A California quail perches erect on a fence post, throws his head back, and calls <em>CAAAH . . .  CAAAH . . . chi-CAH, chi-CAH, chi-CAH-go, chi-CAH-go</em>. He then repeatedly calls <em>CAAAH</em>, eventually offering another <em>chi-CAH-go</em> series at 2:00. Another bird in the background no doubt spurs him on. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>A second California quail, sage thrasher, killdeer, Brewer's sparrow, distant highway traffic </p>
