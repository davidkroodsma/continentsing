<p>A Henslow's sparrow, blown about in the wind on a dead stalk from last years growth, singing his heart out. Its a song that has prompted some to use terms like pathetic, but I know better. I inspect the sonagram of this fine sparrow, seeing the sliding whistles that begin up about 10,000 Hz and drop down to 4,000. </p>

<p>Showing no mercy, I include all 32 of his songs over nearly two minutes.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Prairie warbler, indigo bunting, and the hiss of a windy day.</p>
