<p>Clearly not all northern mockingbirds are equal in their ability (or willingness) to mimic; this bird is a marvel, his immediate neighbor not so much. </p>

<p>I hear clear mimicry (a few examples listed here):</p>

<p>Western kingbird (same call at 0:07 and 6:48)</p>

<p>Magpie (same call at 0:13 and 7:07)</p>

<p>House sparrow (same call at 2:19, 8:47)</p>

<p>Red-bellied woodpecker (same  <em>kwirr</em> call at 5:25, 9:30)</p>

<p>Northern cardinals (1:49, 3:35, 7:02, 8:39)</p>

<p>American robin (0:37)</p>

<p>Bell's vireo (0:45)</p>

<p>Great crested flycatcher (4:53)</p>

<p>Killdeer (7:05). </p>

<p>Is that a northern flicker <em>wik-wik-wik</em> song at 2:56? 
Maybe not quite.</p>

<p>The <em>WHITE!</em> of the <em>BOB-WHITE!</em> call of the northern bobwhite at 5:37-5:42? I think so.</p>

<p>Someone who really knows western birds will hear a lot more mimicry here than I do.</p>

<p>And how this mockingbird loves rock wrens! Mockingbirds from Missouri east seem to love Carolina wrens, because each wren has so many different songs and their style of repetition within a song fits well with the natural tendencies of the mockingbird. Its the same with the rock wren, given how this wren also repeats a particular phrase several times in each song. So I listen to the seven song bursts from 0:18 to 0:35 and I hear a rock wren running through some of his hundred or so different songs; much of the section from 4:01 to 4:52 also sounds like rock wren to me, and 7:10 to 7:26, and 9:02 to 9:24, as well as isolated songs here and there (e.g., at 1:01, 6:01).</p>

<p>Yes, this northern mockingbird is a marvel, which leads me to wonder why his neighbor sings such a different tune with so little mimicry. Perhaps theres an age difference, with the older bird doing more mimicry? Id love to know.</p>
