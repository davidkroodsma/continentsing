<p>The dawn song of a black-and-white warbler. He begins high in the tree with a couple of softer notes, then gives two of his standard dawn chips before singing. Its a four-parted song he delivers, the rhythm distinctively different from his one-parted, daytime <em>weesee- weesee- weesee-weesee</em> song.</p>

<p>He sings at a good clip, a song every eight seconds or so, seven songs per minute.</p>

<p>The dawn song given mid-morning? Yes, when excitedly interacting with another male or highly disturbed about something, a male warbler will give his dawn song any time during the day.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Eastern phoebe, hooded warbler, red-eyed vireo</p>
