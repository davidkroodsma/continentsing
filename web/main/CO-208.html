<p>What a surprise! These pinyon jays dominate the mid-morning soundscape. How many jays are here I can only guess, as they leap-frog past me, the flock continuously moving. From a distance I gather in the frantic calling by the young jays, registering an occasional swallowing sound as (as if?) a young bird is fed by an adult (e.g., 0:11, 0:15). </p>

<p>For the first three and a half minutes the young birds call, with adult laughing-like calls in the background. Then, an adult lands near me, overseeing the entire operation, me included, calling loudly at 4:02, 4:29, <em>yah-ah-ah . . . yah-ah-ah</em>  . . . and then five more times after a full minutes pause. At 5:10, he calls as he departs, then calls in the distance as he flies off, following the horde.</p>
