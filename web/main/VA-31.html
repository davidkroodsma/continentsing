<p>An eastern phoebe alternates the only two songs that he knows, his <em>FEE-b-bre-be</em> with the stuttered ending (0:03, 0:07, etc.) and his <em>FEE-bee</em> with the raspy ending (0:05, 0:10, etc). Only once does he break rhythm, at 1:05, when he sings two <em>FEE-bee</em> songs back-to-back. </p>

<p>And he has rhythm. See MO-150 for how to listen more closely to his rhythm.</p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>The three-parted dawn song of a black-and-white warbler (best heard at 0:12, off to the right in this stereo recording), indigo bunting; early morning wind on the Parkway.</p>
