<p>In his local voice, from Haysai, Virginia, up in the hills on the border between Virginia and Kentucky, Terry Owens, a largely self-taught naturalist at the Breaks Interstate Park, enthuses about the birds and their sounds at the Park. He loves his wobblers, the pileated woodpecker, yellow-billed cuckoo, barred owl, and whip-poor-will; tells where to find the rare Swainsons warbler in the Park; and cant get enough of the dawn chorus: Its just beautiful. </p>

<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Oh so distant, a yellow-throated warbler, American robin. </p>
