A ruby-crowned kinglet for four minutes. Some songs are the full treatment, beginning with high thin notes, falling down, rising, galloping on the end with a double note, such as the first full song from 0:06 to 0:10.

But often he skips all the preliminaries and just offers the terminal galloping notes, such as at 0:13.  

See [CO-210](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-210) for some notes on how to listen to these songs.
