From the bough of a pine tree hanging out over the road, a third field sparrow offers his unique tune. Each song is a gem, beginning with five or six tonal whistles, with successive whistles rising and lengthening; following that introductory phrase is an abrupt change to a rapid trill of down-slurred whistles, given with increasing tempo.
 
Seventeen songs over the five minutes that I listened to him makes for a leisurely pace of three to four songs per minute.

#####Background
Rain. The summer tanager sings loudly nearby. Distant birds: Kentucky warbler, red-eyed vireo, common yellowthroat.
