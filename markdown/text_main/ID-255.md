A broad-tailed hummingbird calls a few times, then takes flight, the whistle in his wings fading into the distance as he disappears into space. How beautiful his wing whistles as I look on the computer monitor, and how nice to calculate wing speed: 42, 45, 48, 48, 48, and 47 beats per second I calculate for successive beats of 10.

Ruby-crowned kinglet, a calling American robin.
