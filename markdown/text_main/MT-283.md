He perches on a fence post that runs through the open meadow here, offering the unique silhouette of a Wilson's snipe against the sky. 

He calls, a rising crescendo, _TIK-TIK-TIK-TIK-TIK_, three series of them, then just after a minute lowers the volume to a soft two-syllable _a-TIK’-a-TIK’-a-TIK’-a-TIK’-a-TIK’_. 

His expression is wonderfully varied, from loud TIK series to the softer _a-TIK’_ calls. 
#####Background
