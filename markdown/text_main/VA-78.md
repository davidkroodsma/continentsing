The daytime singing of a black-and-white warbler. It’s a high, thin, piercing song of see-sawing couplets, two notes alternated here seven to eight times. _Weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee-weesee_ he sings, with a strong accent on the _wee_, the _see_ higher and softer. Or perhaps you hear _squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky-squeaky_, much like rubbing a wet rag over glass. Whatever mnemonic you use, it’s a distinctive song.
