A mountain chickadee calls initially, offering its classic _tsick-a-dee-dee_ (0:10), then sings its pure tonal whistles: _be-bee-bee, be-bee-bee-bee, be-bee-bee-ba-baa_, with the ending _ba-baa_ lower in frequency, and other combinations. One could think of his complete song throughout as _be-bee-bee-bee-ba-baa_, with many of his renditions simply incomplete, omitting various notes.
 
How he thinks of his songs is, of course, a different matter.
