Nearly seven minutes of real time from the Pacific shore.

Nothing takes me _there_ more, imagining myself standing on the Pacific shore, than the long calls of western gulls at Seal Rock headland, over the roar of the surf below. Add the calls of oystercatchers and guillemots to the soundscape and, well, this is _The Pacific_.
#####Background
Black oystercatchers (1:10), pigeon guillemots with high wheezy voices on occasion (e.g., 0:57, 3:02-3:20).
