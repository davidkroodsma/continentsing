A western tanager in dawn song. He begins with four slowly delivered song phrases, then his signature call, the _pit-er-ick_, here sounding perhaps more like a shortened, two-syllable _per-dick_. 

Measuring a few of his song phrases, I calculate that he sings about 1.4 song phrases per second. Thatâ€™s a typical slow dawn pace for these tanagers.
