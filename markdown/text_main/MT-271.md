Still another white-crowned sparrow of this local dialect. He sings from an aspen just a few feet away, 15 essentially identical songs over three minutes. 

Here's a quick comparison of the songs of these three neighboring white-crowned sparrows: [MT-269](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=MT-269), [MT-270](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=MT-270), [MT-271](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=MT-271).

#####Background
American robin, an air-borne swallow (tree swallow?), sapsucker drums, ruffed grouse drum (0:59, 3:05—nice “eastern species”; with a second drumming grouse in the distance—best seen in sonagrams along the baseline, a challenge to actually hear), female elk in distance, mountain chickadee, ruby-crowned kinglet, MacGillivray's warbler, warbling vireo.
