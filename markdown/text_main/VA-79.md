An American redstart in daytime song, repeating the same song over and over with no chipping between songs. I hear it as _see-a see-a see-ut_, each _see-a_ slurred downward, the _see-ut_ ending distinctly lower. In each of the eight songs here, he is on message, each song seemingly identical to all the others, or at least to the best of his ability. 

Compare this daytime singing with the energized dawn singing of a redstart in [KY-75](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=KY-75)
#####Background
