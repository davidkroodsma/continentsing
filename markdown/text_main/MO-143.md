Two kingfishes, male and female, conversing in kingfisher rattles. First to arrive is the female; she calls a few times, until the male arrives (about 0:25). They continue their banter, flying among the branches on the dead tree lying in the river, until theyâ€™ve had their say and then fly off. 

(I failed to get my kingfisher recording on our cross-country bicycle journey, so resorted to borrowing this recording from Massachusetts.)
