With the songs of a hermit thrush prominent, a Clark's nutcracker calls nearby, _Shraaaaaaaaaa_, repeatedly. Both are songbirds, one a thrush, the other a corvid (in the jay and crow family). Both species get along just fine with the sounds that they make, but what a contrast in the sound quality of these two birds. 
#####Background
