One Townsend's warbler is in the foreground, a second in the background, both singing the local dawn song, typically with two short _zweee_ notes, a much louder and longer _ZWEEEEE_, followed by the two loud concluding _TSCHEW_ notes: 

_zwee zwee ZWEEEEE TSCHEW TSCHEW_.
 
Listen to the vigorous chipping of the foreground bird, with singles, doubles, and even triple chips, up to 20 or so total chips between songs, which are delivered at a rate of about nine per minute. 

Compare the dawn singing of the closely related black-throated green warbler back East ([VA-61](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-61)), and you'll hear a similar energy.
