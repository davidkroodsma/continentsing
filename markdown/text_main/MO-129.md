It’s too dark to see him, but he can’t be more than ten yards from me, an Acadian flycatcher in dawn song; he delivers ten or so _peet_ calls before what is known as the typical _PEET-sah_ song that can be heard throughout the day. Over these two minutes, he runs through ten series of his _peet_ calls, each of which culminates in a single _PEET-sah_.
