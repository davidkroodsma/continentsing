About 20 yards away up in the top of a spruce tree he sings, racing through his repertoire of carols and _hisselly_s. The norm is two or three carols followed by one or two _hisselly_s, about a song every second, 60 per minute. 

As I watch the sonagrams fly by on the computer monitor, I can pick out both carols and _hisselly_s that recur, and I marvel at all that he has in his head and how he has chosen to play it all out.

Wilson's snipe winnows, and general songbird chorus in the background.
