_Tseee tseee tseee tsee tsee tse tse tew tew tew tew tew tew te te te tee-LETT tee-LETT tee-LETT tee-LETT tee-LETT_. All 17 songs in this four and a half minute recording! 

These are special songs beginning high and thin in a squeaky voice, squeezing out two or so seconds of _tseee_ notes that gradually shorten, then plummeting to the lower _tew tew te te_ notes, which also shorten and drop in frequency, before ending in the galloping, emphatic _tee-LETT tee-LETT_ series. It is a masterpiece! 

That broad-tailed hummingbird in the background? 44 beats of his wings/second, matching some earlier calculations. Nice.
