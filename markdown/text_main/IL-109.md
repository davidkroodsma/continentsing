Five songs from a second dickcissel near the Cora coal works on Levee Road along the Mississippi. Listen especially to the first and third songs, because they are the only complete songs that include the high trill on the end of the song. It is that complete song that matches the songs of the other dickcissels here.
#####Background
Indigo bunting, mourning dove, tufted titmouse, warbling vireo, Carolina wren, red-winged blackbird, and an idling tugboat along the Mississippi river.
