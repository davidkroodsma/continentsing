For good measure, here is that indigo bunting who sings in the background of [VA-95](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-95). He is now in focus, the quality of his songs perfectly sharp. Thereâ€™s no hint of instability in the songs of either immaculately indigo male, suggesting that they are both returning adults, members of a mini-dialect here. 
#####Background
A whip-poor-will sings, speeding up his delivery for a final few songs at 0:30.
