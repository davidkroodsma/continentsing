Acorn woodpeckers among the oak trees, coming and going, calling, and eventually one drums (0:47), though weakly, at the relatively slow rate of 16 beats/second. 

Single calls might sound a bit like _thhwaack_; when two birds are calling, listen to how their individual voices differ. The call more befitting their clown-like faces is a laughing, two-syllable _whack-a, whack-a_ (0:25).
