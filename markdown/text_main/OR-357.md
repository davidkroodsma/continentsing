Bewick's wren, ten songs in a little under a minute, a song every five to six seconds. This is the third song type from this male.

Here are the four different Bewick's wren songs that I recorded at my favorite Finley refuge location: [OR-355](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-355), [OR-356](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-356), [OR-357](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-357), [OR-358](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-358).
