A loggerhead shrike, with precision, the same song over and over, but how “monotonously” he sings, or so I expect some would say. Roughly a song every two seconds, more than 30 songs per minute for over five minutes, well over 150 total. 

He sings in such a repetitive mode here, as if he had no other songs he could offer. But he does have many others, making one wonder why he doesn’t show them off a little more.
