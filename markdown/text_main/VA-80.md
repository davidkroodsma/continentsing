The same hooded warbler who was in dawn song earlier this morning now gives his daytime song, _weet-weet-weet-weeto_. At six to seven songs per minute, itâ€™s the same song over and over. The only detectable variation seems to be the number of _weet_ notes before the ending _weeto_; having grown accustomed to three _weet_ notes, the four in the song at 0:57 feels like quite a departure from the routine.
