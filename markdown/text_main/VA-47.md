A black-throated blue warbler singing his daytime song at ever so leisurely a pace. Itâ€™s the same song over and over, the expected four or five raspy notes with the last one higher and rising, but he has his own unique rhythm to the song, something like _z-zeer-zeer-zer-zree_. He sits quietly on a perch up slope from the Canada warbler, preening between songs, but mostly just surveying his domain.
#####Background
