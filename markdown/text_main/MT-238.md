In the rain, a least flycatcher struts his stuff, a _cheBEK_ repeated over and over, faster than one per second. The song genes of this bird are basically the same as they are for the birds back in Virginia (see VA-54, VA-55)

By 1:20, this least flycatcher is joined by a gray catbird, both of them now singing in the rain. I hear no continuously stunning mimicry from this catbird, though thereâ€™s the occasional sound reminding me of . . . an American robin (1:21, 1:47), tree swallow (1:41), a _Klee-yer!_ call of a flicker (1:50), a perfect _bzeeyeer_ of a western wood-pewee (2:45).
