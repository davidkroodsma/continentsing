Wood thrushes use their sharp _whit whit_ notes upon awaking and going to roost. These two birds are going to roost, and at first they call sharply, _whit-whit-whit_, back and forth, engaging in some intense pre-roost ritual. Over the nearly five minute interaction here, one bird stays near, but the second retreats off to the right, the interaction fading and surging repeatedly, surging with sharp _whit-whit-whit_ calls, fading with softer _pup-pup-pup_ calls, with an occasional incomplete song thrown in (e.g., 2:44), until all is quiet.
