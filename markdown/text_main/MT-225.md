A light rain doesn’t stop this willow flycatcher from perching out in the open and singing.

In the first two 30-second segments (see [KY-82](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=KY-82) for description of the songs):  

_Creet, FITZ-bew, FITZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, FIZZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, creet_

_FITZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, creet, FIZZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew, creet, FITZ-bew_

I find curious the relative abundance of the three sounds. Eight _creet_’s, eight _FITZ-bew_’s, but only two _FIZZ-bew_’s. He has choices, I know, as to how he uses his three songs, though I don’t know why he would sing more of one than another. 

I wonder what he does in minutes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 here? Be my guest as you chart them out and try to determine for yourself what he's up to.
