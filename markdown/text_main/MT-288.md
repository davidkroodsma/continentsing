A northern waterthrush and his neighbor sing initially, each with a typical three-parted song. The songs of these birds are almost identical to each other, best heard in back-to-back songs from the two birds beginning at 0:03 and again at 0:12. The background bird then becomes less noticeable. 

A song sparrow chimes in (0:08), repeating his song in the background until he’s last heard at 1:34. 

How stunning to hear the familiar, loud _hey-sweetie_ of a black-capped chickadee (0:31)! It’s a nice reminder of how similar these learned songs are across the country. 

After the last northern waterthrush song (at 1:34), yellow warblers dominate the background, the chickadee offering a few more _hey-sweetie_ songs as well. 
#####Background
A second northern waterthrush, Wilson's snipe winnows, song sparrow, black-capped chickadee (0:31), veery, yellow warbler, and the ever present rippling of this North Fork of the Big Hole River.
