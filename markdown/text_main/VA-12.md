Introduced from England during the late 1800’s, they are perhaps the only non-authentic feature of current-day colonial Williamsburg, where these birds are abundant.

These particular house sparrows were one of many encounters beside the road, from Virginia to Oregon, these particular birds calling from a thicket as we rode by. 

What a racket they can make, and what variety in their voices! There are chatters and _chirrups_ and _cheeps_ and you name it, all signifying something important to them, but their meaning to us a mystery. Any one who says these birds aren’t worth listening to hasn’t truly listened to them!
