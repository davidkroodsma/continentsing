Seven daytime songs of a Brewer's Sparrow, each a second-long buzzy phrase followed by a second and a half series of repeated syllables. Perhaps you hear it as something like _zrreeeeeeeee zir zir zir zir zir zir zir_.

One thinks of the Brewer's Sparrow as inhabiting arid sagebrush, but as heard in this recording, this male has set up residence next to a delightful stream that drains the mountainside here.
