Seven daytime songs of a Brewer's Sparrow, each a second-long buzzy phrase followed by a second and a half series of repeated syllables. Perhaps you hear it as something like _zrreeeeeeeee zir zir zir zir zir zir zir_.

One thinks of the Brewer's Sparrow as inhabiting arid sagebrush, but as heard in this recording, this male has set up residence next to a delightful stream that drains the mountainside here.

Listening to the songs of the Brewer's sparrow at dawn ([CO-215](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-215), [CO-216](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-216)) and througout the day ([ID-219](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-219), [ID-220](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-220)), one can hardly believe they're the same species.
