Seven daytime _bee-bzzzzzzz_ songs of the blue-winged warbler, each song about a second and a half in duration. Notice how quiet the background is compared to the cacophony of the dawn chorus.
#####Background
Ovenbird, hooded warbler, American crow, eastern towhee, red-bellied woodpecker, and a lone fly.
