Just across the Mississippi River from the Cora coal works is another distinctive song dialect. 

Here are five songs from dickcissel number 1 in the Perryville dialect.

I walk down the road, listening to one dickcissel after another, all lined up on the utility poles. How remarkably similar their songs, how each has conformed to the local dialect here. In the sonagrams I study, I can see they agree on the details of the _dick dick_ notes before the songs; and the two-parted song is stunningly similar among males, too, typically three low phrases followed by two higher, reedy trills. 

Here's a summary of the dickcissel dialects you can listen to:
