Near the Cora coal works on Levee Road along the Illinois side of the Mississippi river, three dickcissels sing on neighboring territories, all conforming to the local dialect. Here are 5 songs from the first male. 

For these males, each song is preceded by at least one call, and often more: _dick, dick, dick_. Next comes a relatively high, complex single phrase, then typically three low notes followed by a high trill. Sometimes that high trill is left off the end, but otherwise these males sing with one voice, all three agreeing on the details of the _dick_ call and the song for this neighborhood. 
#####Background
American robin, great crested flycatcher, other dickcissels, mourning dove, all of which are barely heard above the roar of a tugboat docked nearby. Moving coal . . . Train whistle.
