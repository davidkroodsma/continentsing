This field sparrow is fired up! He’s into the dawn chorus, using his complex dawn song, which consists of four different phrases; call them A, B, C, and D. But, as in the first song, he can’t seem to stop after an A B C D sequence; instead, he gives two extra phrases, so that the song is A B C D B C. 

The next song is A B C D, then A B C, and then (at 0:33) he chips frantically before the next song, which is an A B C D B C again. Those chips are reminiscent of the dawn effort of the Brewer’s sparrow, a closely related species in the genus _Spizella_. Overall, it’s quite a performance by this field sparrow.

How different these dawn songs are from the leisurely daytime bouncing ball songs ([VA-19](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-19), [VA-20](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-20), [VA-21](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-21), [KY-93](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=KY-93)).
