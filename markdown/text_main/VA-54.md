A least flycatcher, a neighbor to the bird singing in [VA-55](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-55), races through his _cheBEK_ songs at a clip of about 70 songs per minute. He adds one other sound from his repertoire, a light twitter at 0:04, a call often given as he changes perches, but here just given between songs from the same perch. 
#####Background
Dark-eyed junco, American robin, mourning dove, and a neighboring least flycatcher. Beginning at about 30 seconds, one can hear a car passing on the nearby highway.
