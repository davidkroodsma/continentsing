A Henslow's sparrow perches atop a small forb on the Regal Prairie trail at Prairie State Park, proudly, I would like to think, offering his half-second masterpiece to all who would hear. _Tsilick_ doesn’t do it justice, or _hiccup_, especially when the song is slowed down so that we can hear the details that the birds themselves no doubt hear (see [MO-165](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=MO-165)).
 
I can hear the complaints: Over two minutes for this singer? Really? Why not play just a few songs and then move on to something more exciting? It’s not in my nature to do so. 
#####Background
Northern bobwhite, dickcissel, another Henslow's sparrow, yellow-breasted chat.
