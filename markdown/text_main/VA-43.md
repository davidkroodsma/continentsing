Just 10 or so yards away, a chestnut-sided warbler is in dawn song, chipping between songs, delivering the same rambling “unaccented ending” song throughout. He’s a puzzle, because he has a whole repertoire of these dawn songs stored in his head, and he could choose to sing any one of them, but he specializes in this particular one. 
#####Background
Two brown thrashers (?) _churr_ repeatedly throughout, suggesting I may be near their nest or young. Dogs, a cow, crowing rooster, together with mourning dove, eastern towhee, American crow.
