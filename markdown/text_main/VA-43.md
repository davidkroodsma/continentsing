Just 10 or so yards away, a chestnut-sided warbler is in dawn song, chipping between songs, delivering the same rambling “unaccented ending” song throughout. He’s a puzzle, because he has a whole repertoire of these dawn songs stored in his head, and he could choose to sing any one of them, but he specializes in this particular one. 

Compare these dawn, aggressive songs of the chestnut-sided warbler with its mate-attraction songs  ([VA-40](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-40), [VA-41](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-41).and [VA-42](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-42)).
#####Background
Two brown thrashers (?) _churr_ repeatedly throughout, suggesting I may be near their nest or young. Dogs, a cow, crowing rooster, together with mourning dove, eastern towhee, American crow.
