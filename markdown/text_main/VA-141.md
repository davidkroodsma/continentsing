A house wren bubbles and gurgles his song. He has a few false starts (e.g. 0:25), but the 16 full length songs are remarkably consistent from one to the next. We come to expect that kind of consistency among many songbirds, but not the house wren, for when he sings excitedly, often no two songs are alike. We might surmise that thereâ€™s nothing exciting going on in his life at this very moment.
