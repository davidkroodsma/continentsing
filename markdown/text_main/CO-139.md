In the dense hedge beside the road, with the cattle just beyond, just listen to this flock of _chirrup_ing and chattering House Sparrows! Listen to just the first few seconds and perhaps youâ€™ve had enough, but I let them carry on here for over four minutes!

(OK, I sneaked this recording in from just off the bike route in Colorado; it was just too good and too typical of what we heard in so many places from our bicycles, but I never managed to record the birds well on the bike route itself.)
#####Background
cattle, mourning dove, ring-necked pheasant (0:32), wind.
