A sage thrasher at dawn. For openers, he offers a song that takes a minute and ten seconds to finish. He pauses at most ten seconds, and he’s singing again, but this time for only half a minute. His longest is about a minute and 20 seconds. 

I don’t hear a lot of mimicry, though every once in a while there’s a California quail (0:32, 0:45, 1:23, 1:48, 3:34, 6:45—and more, I’m sure, as I made no concerted effort to find them all; perhaps you can find others). At 3:18 there’s a nice imitation of a female red-winged blackbird’s call. Almost certainly a willet at 5:00.
