From atop a maple beside the road, this American redstart is in full dawn mode. He chips vigorously between songs, and in this one-minute sample sings three different songs in a somewhat unpredictable sequence: A B C A B C C A C C B. 

He has another song that he hides now, but after the dawn chorus is over, heâ€™ll bring that one out, singing only it during more relaxed daytime singing. You can hear that daytime style of repetitive singing in [VA-79](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-79)
