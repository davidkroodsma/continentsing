Six minutes of this? You have to be kidding, I can almost hear the complaint. Yes, nine minutes. This savannah sparrow takes me there, beside the Firehole River in the Upper Geyser Basin, and for the full nine minutes he tells all that is on his mind, the one song over and over, in all its glory. 
#####Background
Mountain chickadee, American robin, ruby-crowned kinglet, spotted sandpiper (0:50, 2:42), yellow-rumped warbler, and the Firehole River running nearby, together with occasional bubblings and gurglings of more distant geysers.
