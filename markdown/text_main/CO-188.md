A Cassin's sparrow singing at a leisurely pace, 17 songs over five minutes, a song every 15 to 20 seconds. His song repertoire size of three is played out in the following sequence, minute by minute: 

A B B C 

B B A
 
A B B 

B B A 

A C B 

B . . .

In this brief selection he clearly favors song B, and song C is least used.
 
But that’s only part of what he’s up to. With every other song or so, he launches into the air, singing on the wing, sky-dancing around his territory.
