A great crested flycatcher in dawn song.
 
Back-to-back _wheeee-up_ songs are always different, and it sounds like he mostly alternates a low frequency, low-intensity _wheeee-up_ with a high frequency, high-intensity, more raspy _wheeee-up_.  

With all of the other birds here in full dawn mode, that low, soft buzzy note interspersed among the louder _wheeee-up_ calls is often difficult to hear. Train your ears on 0:12 for the first truly audible low note, again at 0:22; he doesn’t always give it after every two _wheeee-up_s, and here it’s tough to distinguish the flycatcher’s low note from the occasional low notes of a chat in the background.

He embellishes the dawn message a little at 1:24, a hint of the rich, raucous repertoire to follow during the daytime. Immediately after that, hear how he gives two of the high-intensity, high-frequency, raspy _wheeee-up_s back to back.
