A Pacific-slope flycatcher in dawn song, his three songs indistinguishable to my ears from his close relative the cordilleran flycatcher (actually, the debate is still raging as to whether the Pacific-slope and cordilleran flycatchers are separate species). 

The first three songs are 1) the high, thin _seeet_, 2) the longish, two-syllable _ka-SLWEEP_, and 3) the harsher _pa-TIK_. In the first 30 seconds of this recording, he sings this _seeet, ka-SLWEEP, pa-TIK_ sequence 11 times, as this is his favored sequence throughout the entire recording. Only once, at 0:38, does he insert an extra _ka-SLWEEP_ into the sequence.

Here, compare for yourself the songs of the cordilleran flycatcher ([ID-202](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-202)) with those of the Pacific-slope flycatcher ([OR-362](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-362)). Do they sound like two different species to you?
