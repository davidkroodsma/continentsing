A prairie warbler offering five of his buzzy, daytime songs. The notes in these buzzy songs are brief, about seven per second, with a longer buzzy note on the end. These are the “mate-attraction songs,” those used when the male is interacting with females, or singing in a relaxed state.

Contrast these buzzy songs with the more tonal, aggressive songs that males use when fighting or during the dawn chorus (see [VA-33](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-33)). 

#####Background
