In the predawn darkness, a hermit thrush can be elusive and skittish, and I sneak from one of his singing perches to another trying to capture him, but he never seems to settle down. Then, when I think it is a lost cause, he lands just above me, in clear view, offering this remarkable series of songs. In the first minute alone are 22 songs, faster than a song every three seconds; for a hermit thrush, heâ€™s singing at light speed!
