In the predawn darkness, a hermit thrush can be elusive and skittish, and I sneak from one of his singing perches to another trying to capture him, but he never seems to settle down. 

Then, when I think it is a lost cause, he lands just above me, in clear view, offering this remarkable series of songs. In the first minute alone are 22 songs, faster than a song every three seconds, near top speed for a hermit thrush. Just listen to him spring from one pitch to another. 

Maybe you can pick out a distinctive song and hear him return to it 10-12 songs later? In [OR-334](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-334) and [OR-347](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-347) I offer suggestions on how to listen to hermit thrushes.
