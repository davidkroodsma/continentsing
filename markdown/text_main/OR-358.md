Bewick's wren, with nine songs. All are of the same type, the fourth song type that Iâ€™ve recorded from this male this morning. The average male wren on the Finley National Wildlife Refuge would have about a dozen more songs, for a total repertoire of 16 different songs.  

Here are the four different Bewick's wren songs that I recorded at my favorite Finley refuge location: [OR-355](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-355), [OR-356](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-356), [OR-357](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-357), [OR-358](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-358).
