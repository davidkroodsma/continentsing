A northern parula in dawn mode, chipping between songs. Two complex phrases start the song, followed by four ascending raspy notes: _twee-de-de-de twee-de-de-de zhree zhreee zhreee zhreee_; he hustles through the _twee-de-de-de_ notes and lingers on the _zhreee_ notes. A western bird, to be sure, given that we are far west of the transition zone in Kentucky, and I wonder whether the dawn songs of the western birds are also consistently different from those of the eastern birds. 
 #####Background
Barely heard above the wind: eastern wood-pewee, Carolina wren.
