A second least flycatcher races through his song repertoire, also delivering everything he knows in just a little over a tenth of a second, in a single _cheBEK_. He pauses a little over half a second and dumps all he knows again, and again, and again, also at a clip of about 70 _cheBEK_ per minute, with short bursts at the rate of nearly 90 songs/minute. He is the neighbor of the male singing in [VA-54](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-54).

Here is the essence of his dawn performance, one _cheBEK_ after another delivered at breakneck speed.
#####Background
A second least flycatcher. Other birds heard in the background are an American robin, dark-eyed junco, mourning dove, tufted titmouse. One rather special, distant bird is a wild turkey gobbling (e.g., 0:16, 0:53).
