Songs of a spotted towhee beside the gurgling Sweetwater River. He offers some variety, with three different songs over three minutes: A A A B B A A A C C C C C C C C C C C C (B is an odd song, or itâ€™s an incomplete version of a fuller song). 

A little after three minutes an American goldfinch lands nearby, rambling on for a good ten seconds.
