With a fine chorus of bullfrogs in the background, a field sparrow delivers his simple daytime song, 11 of them over two minutes. Each song begins with four pure whistled tones, all on the same pitch, taking almost a second; the transition to the rapid trill of upslurred whistles, 13-14/second, is abrupt, making the song sound distinctly two-parted while staying on roughly the same pitch throughout, neither rising nor falling. 

Contrast the daytime singing of this male with his energy during the dawn chorus, in [VA-39](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-39).
#####Background
Blue-gray gnatcatcher, bullfrogs, mourning dove, American robin (calls only), eastern towhee, and an intense, continuous chorus of insects up about 5000 Hz.
