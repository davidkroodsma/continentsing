Twenty-four songs over four minutes, a song every ten seconds, _quick, THREE BEERS!_ I am not sure why the heart warms when I hear this song, but I think it’s because I first heard it on a field trip to northern Michigan way back in 1968 when I was taking my two ornithology courses from Olin Sewall Pettingill Jr. The song was unmistakable then, as it is now, the mnemonic unforgettable: _quick, THREE BEERS!_. Other mnemonics, such as _hip, THREE CHEERS!_, don’t quite measure up.
