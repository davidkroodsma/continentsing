Throughout the night he sang, a bachelor announcing he was available, and at dawn I finally got out of the tent and stood next to him, this brief selection of nearly 15 minutes telling of other birds in his life.

I begin listening . . . hearing imitations . . .

0:14, blue jay

0:19, northern flicker _klee-yer!_ call

0:23, red-bellied woodpecker call

0:25-0:32, northern flicker _klee-yer!_ call again

0:35, blue jay (0:39-0:42, probably also blue jay)

0:46-0:51, purple martin

0:53-0:48, Carolina wren

0:59-1:05, tufted titmouse

Oh, all that in the first minute—he is a fine mimic. I’ll pick out a few of my favorites in the following minutes:

1:26, blue jay and hairy/downy woodpecker call alternated

1:40, Carolina chickadee song

2:16, eastern bluebird

3:22, blue jay

5:18, purple martin

5:48, eastern bluebird again

7:38, northern flicker _wik-wik-wik_ song (again at 9:08, and 11:58)

7:52, tufted titmouse again

11:52, Carolina wren (again)

What a challenge to try to identify all that he has pilfered and translated into mockingbirdese!

#####Background
At this time of the morning, all of Hodgenville’s American robins are singing by streetlights.
