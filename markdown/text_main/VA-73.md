A blue-winged warbler in dawn song. When really excited, he’ll chip regularly between songs, but there’s only a hint of a chip here and there in this somewhat uninspired performance (a single chip at 0:53). 

But it surely is the dawn song, not the _beee-bzzzzzz_ song expected later in the day. This dawn song begins with a few stuttered notes and ends in a buzzy trill, similar in quality to the ending of the daytime song. 
#####Background
Northern cardinal, indigo bunting, hooded warbler (also in dawn song), American robin, mourning dove, red-eyed vireo, distant dogs.
