It’s classic dawn singing by the western tanager, the overall style so similar to that of the scarlet tanager of the East.

Curious about the patterns of use for his song phrases, I print out the first minute of his performance and identify the phrases: A B C, A D E, A D F, A E C, A D E G, A D C E, A B E, A, A B C E, with _pit-er-ick_ calls between the sequences. It’s a pattern I know well, as it’s essentially identical to what the scarlet tanager does. He has a limited repertoire of song phrases (I counted seven), and he favors phrase A, beginning all sequences with it, and during the day he’ll likely begin each song with that phrase as well.
