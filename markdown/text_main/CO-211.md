Seven songs of a Wilson's warbler in the dense vegetation beside a mountain stream. Each song consists of seven sharp V-shaped notes in the sonagrams, building in loudness from the very quiet first to the loudest fifth or sixth notes, the seventh typically trailing off a little in volume. 
#####Background
So quiet among the pines and junipers. Maybe a distant whistling mountain chickadee.
