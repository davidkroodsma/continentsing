Far up on the hillside a juniper titmouse sings, ten songs all of the same kind, though he has several more in his repertoire that he could sing if he chose to do so. The song pulsates, each consisting of six or seven tripled notes, as in _tititi-tititi-tititi-tititi-tititi-tititi_; try saying that in one and a quarter seconds and you get the feeling for what this bird is up to.
