Just 10 yards away, a gray flycatcher sings from low in a juniper, a yard or so off the ground. 

His two songs are obvious: _chu-WIP, chu-WIP, chu-WIP, teeah_, with two to five rough _chu-WIP_s before he seems to complete his thoughts with the higher, tonal _teeah_, and then he starts all over. 

He sings at the rate of about two songs every three seconds, a song every second and a half, about 42 songs in this one-minute sample.

Three neighboring gray flycatchers sing in the predawn darkness here in Temple Canyon: [CO-195](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-195), [CO-196](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-196), [CO-197](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-197).
