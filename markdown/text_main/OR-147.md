Cedar waxwings, with both _seee_ and _bzeee_ calls, but there will be no songs from this songless songbird. Eventually we hear intense _seee_ calls that typically precede flight (beginning about 0:56). 

And off they fly, flapping wings at 16 beats/second, much slower than the hummingbird who zips by (at 1:09) whirring its tiny wings at the rate of 59 beats/second.
