Common sense tells me that I should restrict this gnatcatcher selection to at most half a minute, but when I listen to the variety in this bird’s voice, I need to let him have his say.

He begins with the monotonous repetition of a single _wheeze_, at a clip of well over 100 per minute, a performance for which blue-gray gnatcatchers are well known. But then, after nearly a minute (at 0:49), he changes the quality of that _wheeze_ ever so slightly, then more strikingly at 0:53, and again at 1:12, when he alternates two different wheezes to nice effect, continuing in this mode until 1:48, _and there’s so much more_! 

Just listen to the subtle and not-so-subtle contrast in successive _wheeze_s, how he intersperses periods of seemingly endless repetition (e.g., from about 2:40 to 3:20, and 3:47 to the end) with periods of wonderful variety. 

Having heard this blue-gray gnatcatcher and his neighbor (see [VA-24](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-24)) in such fine form, and wondering what is on their minds during such a performance, I will always wonder why others of their kind limit themselves to what sounds like a single, repeated wheeze for what seems hours on end.
