Nine sharp _PEET-sah_ songs from an Acadian flycatcher. He’s in daytime mode, singing at a leisurely pace of about five songs per minute.

On occasion throughout the night, as if he’s restless for the dawn, this song also explodes from his night roost. 
#####Background
Ovenbird (8 songs throughout), blue-gray gnatcatcher, tufted titmouse, purple martin, red-bellied woodpecker. Some rain dripping from the trees.
