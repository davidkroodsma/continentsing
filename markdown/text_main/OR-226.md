Something has spooked these American crows. They congregate in a cluster of small trees on the hillside, seemingly focusing on and “mobbing” something beneath them. I watch for a fox or a coyote, anything that they might normally mob, yet I see nothing. The ruckus they create attracts the black-billed magpies, and as the intensity of the crow mobbing wanes, the magpies take the stage (story to be continued in [OR-227](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-227)!).
