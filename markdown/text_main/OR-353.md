A brown creeper creeps up the trunk of a Douglas fir tree, singing as he goes. Just seven songs is all he offers before he flies off, but all seven are the same, two high notes, what sounds like three low ones, ending with a single high one: _trees trees murmuring trees_ (the same mnemonic often used for the black-throated green warbler's dawn song).
