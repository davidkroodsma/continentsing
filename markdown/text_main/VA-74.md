The “dawn song” of a black-and-white warbler. He begins high in the tree with a couple of softer notes, then gives two of his standard dawn chips before singing. It’s a four-parted song he delivers, the rhythm distinctively different from his one-parted, daytime _weesee- weesee- weesee-weesee_ song.

He sings at a good clip, a song every eight seconds or so, seven songs per minute.

The “dawn song” given mid-morning? Yes, when excitedly interacting with another male or highly disturbed about something, a male warbler will give his “dawn song” any time during the day.
