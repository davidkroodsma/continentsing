Often throughout the day, one hears these treetop songs, the bird itself rarely seen. In daytime singing, this western wood-pewee offers 21 _bzeeyeer_ songs over three minutes, seven songs per minute. That’s about 1/6th of his dawn pace, and now he sings only his _bzeeyeer_ song—how  differently he sings now compared to his grand performance before sunrise compare, for example, [OR-201](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-201), [MT-275](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=MT-275).
