Great horned owls, a whole family of them! 

The distant adult female hoots first (her _ho ho-ooo hooo hoo_ in first two seconds), followed immediately (after a rising, tonal call by a Swainson's thrush) by a young owl who screeches from the oak trees about 100 yards away. She hoots again (0:09), and the youngster screeches (0:13), but if you listen down low you’ll hear the distant foghorn hooting of the adult male, _ho ho-ooo hooo hoo_, usually immediately after the female (best heard at 0:47, 1:24, but he’s also at 0:14 and 0:23) or before the female (0:56, 1:06)—you’ll probably have to turn the gain on the headphones up to hear him, but then don’t let the youngster break your eardrums!  

In a pretty klutzy editing job, I amplified the hooting of the adult male, and the amplified background gives the first clue that the adult male is hooting.
