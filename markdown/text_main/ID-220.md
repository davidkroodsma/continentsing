Seven daytime songs from a second Brewer's sparrow (see also [ID-219](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-219)). As is typical, the song is two-parted, with the first phrase buzzy, the second part of more slowly repeated syllables. For this male, the first part is lower than the second, something like _zirrrrrrrrrrrrrr zee zee zee zee zee zee zee_. 
#####Background
