Seven daytime songs from a second Brewer's sparrow (see also [ID-219](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-219)). As is typical, the song is two-parted, with the first phrase buzzy, the second part of more slowly repeated syllables. For this male, the first part is lower than the second, something like _zirrrrrrrrrrrrrr zee zee zee zee zee zee zee_. 

Listening to the songs of the Brewer's sparrow at dawn ([CO-215](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-215), [CO-216](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=CO-216)) and througout the day ([ID-219](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-219), [ID-220](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-220)), one can hardly believe they're the same species.
