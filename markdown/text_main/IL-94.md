Daytime singing from a yellow warbler. Unlike his varied dawn chorus, he repeats the same song over and over, the special song from his repertoire of a dozen or so that he saves for daytime singing and interacting with females. 
#####Background
Yellow-breasted chat, red-winged blackbird, a frog; late morning, the wind has picked up, hissing and rustling the phragmites nearby.
