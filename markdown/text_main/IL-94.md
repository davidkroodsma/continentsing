Daytime singing from a yellow warbler. Unlike his varied dawn chorus, he repeats the same song over and over, the special song from his repertoire of a dozen or so that he saves for daytime singing and interacting with females. 

You can compare the repetitive singing in this recording with energized dawn singers in [ID-309](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-309) and [ID-310](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=ID-310).
#####Background
Yellow-breasted chat, red-winged blackbird, a frog; late morning, the wind has picked up, hissing and rustling the phragmites nearby.
