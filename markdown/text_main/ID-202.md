 (I couldn’t resist providing the entire six and a half minutes, just a brief selection from what this flycatcher does every dawn.)

A cordilleran flycatcher, no doubt—can’t be the sound-alike Pacific-slope flycatcher, as I’m well east of their range along the Pacific. I hear the three different songs, the first four songs being _ka-SLWEEP, ka-SLWEEP, pa-TIK, seeet_. The _ka-SLWEEP_ is sharply tonal and rising; the _pa-TIK_ is an abrupt, harsh double note; the _seeet_ a single high tonal note. Very distinctive, I try to convince myself, and that I’d know this bird anywhere, unless I’m anywhere near the Pacific, of course, where the sound-alike, look-alike, maybe-even-the-same-species Pacific-slope flycatcher lives. 

But there’s a small complication, a fourth type of vocalization given at 2:02, and then it occurs sporadically after that (2:28, 2:57, 3:34, 3:43, 3:54, 3:59, 4:16, 5:03, 5:23, 6:25). I wonder what to make of that? This fourth sound is much like the _ka-SLWEEP_, tonal and rising, but it’s a single note, not distinctly double—more like _suWEET_. Perhaps this is the “position note” that the birds use throughout the day, and it creeps into the singing here when the bird is less motivated to sing. I need to spend more time among these flycatchers, to get to know them better.
