A western black-capped chickadee, typical of most birds from Kansas west to the crest of the Cascades. 

The fourth song (at 0:18) is especially sharp and clear, telling of the two-toned _hey-sweetie_ that is the signature whistle of these birds almost everywhere. I say “almost” because just a few days ride to the west (see [OR-349](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-359)) will reveal black-capped chickadees who know nothing of this song to which others of their kind conform. 
#####Background
Yellow warbler, black-billed magpie, American crow, mourning dove.
