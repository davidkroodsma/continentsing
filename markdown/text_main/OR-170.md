A common nighthawk patrolling its territory at dawn. As he circles about, he calls _peent . . .peent . . . peent_ . . . faster than one every two seconds. Just barely can we follow his erratic flight, and then he dives sharply, _VROOM_ing loudly at the bottom of his dive. In this four minute segment, he dives and _VROOM_s ten times, about once every 25 seconds, _peent_ing ten to 12 times between successive dives.

The _peent_s of a nearby common nighthawk can on occasion be heard in the background, as during the first ten seconds; even more distant _VROOM_s are heard, because the low-frequency booming sound carries so much farther than the higher _peeent_s (e.g., 0:13, 0:17, though both are partially masked by the foreground _peent_; better heard at 0:51, when two males can be heard in the distance, the first off to the right, the second to the left). 
#####Background
Wind, ring-necked pheasant, western kingbird, western meadowlark, and an early morning breeze whistling through the sage.
