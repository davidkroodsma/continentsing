Two male western meadowlarks argue at their territory boundary. The near male sings loudly (at 0:04), followed immediately by the background male. Until about 0:50, the two males take turns singing, then the far male recedes into the distance. After seven songs, the near male calls, _chupp . . . chupp . . .chupp_, the far male responding (at 1:52) with the rattling _vicicicicicicicicicicic_. The near male continues calling _chupp_, then offers three sharp, down-slurred whistles, followed by more _chupp_s and eventually a song. If you had listened closely to this male’s first seven songs, you’ll hear that he’s now changed his tune, choosing to sing another of the half dozen or so songs in his repertoire.
