These two warblers are often heard together throughout the South. First up is the Kentucky warbler’s chortling _chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree-chuuree_, followed immediately by the hooded warbler’s pure _weet-weet-weet-weeto_. They seem to share the airwaves, with the four songs of the Kentucky never overlapping the six of the hooded.
