A western kingbird in dawn song. In the predawn darkness I can walk up to him and listen closely, hearing his feet shuffle on the perch, hearing every little _kip_ and _ki-PEP_ and _PEEP_ that he makes.

I love the energy in his dawn singing, _kip kip kip kip kip kip ki-PIP ki-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP-PEEP_.
#####Background
Occasional dive sound of common nighthawk (0:05, 0:19, 0:44), ring-necked pheasant.
