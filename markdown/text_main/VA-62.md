The persistent daytime _zee zee zee zee zee zoo zree_ of a black-throated green warbler, with almost always five tonal _zee_ notes, followed by a single low tonal _zoo_ note, then the buzzy _zree_ on the end. Well into the morning now he utters no chips between songs, well after heâ€™s abandoned his _zree zree zoo zoo zree_ dawn song (see [VA-61](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=VA-61)). 
#####Background
The persistent singing of a golden-crowned kinglet (see [OR-337](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=OR-337)). And, at 1:57, every so faintly, what sounds like the single call of a Swainson's thrush!
