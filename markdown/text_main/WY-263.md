Some of the best things in life are all too brief. Here is a Cassin's finch singing quietly in the treetop, apparently courting a female, and he lets loose with a fascinating, continuous series of mimicked sounds. 

What all do I hear? 

I hear an American robin call (_tut_, at 0:01 and again at 0:04, 0:05, and more)

the galloping chant of a Ruby-crowned Kinglet (0:02, 0:12)

the _Klee-yer!_ call of a northern flicker (0:04, 0:12)

a dark-eyed junco song (perhaps; 0:06, also at 0:08)

a different American robin call (0:01, 0:07, and again at 0:09)

maybe calls of a red crossbill (0:11, 0:17),

but I’m sure there’s more in there that I don’t recognize. 

What a surprise to hear all that he’s capable of doing. You’d never guess based on his more common songs ([WY-264](http://listeningtoacontinentsing.com/recording.php?page=WY-264)) all that he has up his sleeve!

The muted roar of geysers and the Firehole River in the Upper Basin at Yellowstone National Park.
