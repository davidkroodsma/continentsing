We have heard the summer tanagers calling and singing from the Atlantic through the Ozarks, throughout the East. This particular bird calls late afternoon in a park in downtown Ellington, Missouri. Itâ€™s the standard _pit-i-tuck_, though rather extended, with the number of _tuck_s greater than usual. In general, he sounds annoyed or distressed about something, though only he knows what is on his mind.
