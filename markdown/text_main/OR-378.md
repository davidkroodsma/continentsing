My spotted towhee sings five songs, and nearly 40 minutes after I last listened to him he has returned to sing one of the songs I heard from him before (see OR-374). I enjoy the towhee, but it is the American crow who flies by during the fourth song who grabs my attention (6-7 wing beats/sec). 

I let the towhee sing one more song before swinging the parabolic microphone over to the crow, who shuffles on the perch, keeping balance, then _caw_s. In his fourth series (beginning at 1:13), he launches, cawing on the wing and fading into the distance, where he offers one more cawing triplet before going silent. These _caw_s are nothing like the robust _caw_ing I expect from crows in the continentâ€™s interior.
